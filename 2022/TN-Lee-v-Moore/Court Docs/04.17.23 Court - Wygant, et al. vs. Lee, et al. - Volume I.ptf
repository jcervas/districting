157=                                   (The aforementioned cause came on to be
158=                heard Monday, April 17, 2023, before the Honorable Russell
159=                T. Perkins, Chief Judge; J. Michael Sharp, Judge; and
160=                Steven W. Maroney, Chancellor, beginning at approximately
161=                9:20 a.m., when the following proceedings were had,
162=                to-wit:)
163=       
164=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Are the parties ready to
165=                proceed?
166=                                   MR. TIFT:  Yes, Your Honor.
167=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Yes, Your Honor.
168=                                   MR. TIFT:  And we can explain to the
169=                Court the binders all in front of you, if you'd like.
170=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Let's do it.
171=                                   MR. TIFT:  Okay.  So the parties worked
172=                together on all proposed exhibits and reached an agreement
173=                to admit many of them without even needing to go through
174=                the normal process of, "Do you recognize this document,"
175=                with the witness.
176=                                   And so the binders contain every
177=                possible exhibit that either side wants to use.  Our
178=                intention, which was agreed, is that all of those that we
179=                agree are admissible and should be admitted can be
180=                admitted from -- either from right now or as they're used
181=                throughout trial.  And then any of the remainders will be
182=                                       (615) 400-3673                     5

184=                                   At the close of trial, we will work
185=                together to remove anything from the official binder that
186=                was never made an exhibit.  And that way, the binder --
187=                hopefully, it will allow for the smoothest, quickest use
188=                of exhibits in the trial and for a clean record with the
189=                Court's copy.
190=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Great.
191=                                   MR. RIEGER:  And we have -- they're not
192=                in front of Your Honors at the moment, but we have ready
193=                tables of contents, where the exhibits that we have agreed
194=                on should come in without having to go through the
195=                ordinary process have been marked.
196=                                   If the Court would like those, we can
197=                provide those to the Court.  And that will also allow for
198=                easier access to the individual sections of the binder.
199=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.
200=                                   MR. TIFT:  And, I guess, ultimately, we
201=                could read through on the record what we already agree is
202=                admitted.  Whatever the Court prefers for the ones that
203=                there's no dispute on admission, to do it properly.
204=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.  Well, after we
205=                take care of some preliminary matters, the exhibits can
206=                be -- the agreed-upon exhibits can be admitted.
207=                                   I understand there would be some that

fmt=pb
209=                you don't -- we'll have to go through the process on
210=                those.
211=                                   Also, we have several motions pending,
212=                motions in limine.
213=                                   As to the pending motion that we heard
214=                on March 7th, no need for any argument on that.  Our plan
215=                is to -- our hope is to take a break after we hear all
216=                seven motions in limine and come back and announce rulings
217=                on all of them, and also announce ruling -- a ruling --
218=                this is our hope -- on the motion -- the evidentiary
219=                motions we heard on March 7th.
220=                                   I'm ready.
221=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Good morning, Your Honor.
222=                May it please the Court, my name is Jacob Swatley with the
223=                firm Harris Shelton from Memphis.  I'm special counsel to
224=                the defendants in this matter.
225=                                   The first motion in limine -- Motion in
226=                Limine Number 1 to exclude Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Cervas.
227=                                   The hallmark of an expert is
228=                professionalism, of being able to do the job asked first,
229=                and to do it correctly when asked.
230=                                   Additionally, the standard for
231=                excluding an expert is whether their testimony and
232=                opinions will substantially assist the trier of fact and
233=                is trustworthy.
234=                                       (615) 400-3673                     7
fmt=pb
235=                                   We believe that the proceedings in this
236=                case have shown that they are not.  Dr. Cervas needed to
237=                prepare five different reports in this matter, four on the
238=                House, and produced over 20 maps.  Each round contained
239=                non-contiguities in those maps, meaning that somehow the
240=                districts were not connected, either over water, over
241=                land, or even by point contiguity.
242=                                   This is not a very difficult task for
243=                an expert in this field.  Ultimately, I believe at least
244=                12 of those maps were -- had some type of non-contiguity
245=                within them.  I believe a majority of the maps that he
246=                produced had this flaw.
247=                                   Dr. Cervas also showed that during his
248=                deposition and in his reports, he did not -- he testified
249=                that he did not read a single Tennessee case before he
250=                started drawing.
251=                                   As the Court is well aware by now,
252=                redistricting is a complex task.  It requires comparison
253=                of many different variables, often variables that do not
254=                necessarily relate to each other.  Apples and oranges and
255=                peaches, and somehow they all work together to find what
256=                we think is the standard.
257=                                   In Tennessee, you can't understand the
258=                criteria for drawing a map without understanding the case
259=                law that has interpreted the Constitution.  The
260=                                       (615) 400-3673                     8
fmt=pb
261=                Constitution doesn't say split as few counties as
262=                possible, split 30 counties.  The Constitution says:
263=                Don't split any counties.  And only by case law do we have
264=                a standard where it somehow interprets that.
265=                                   Dr. Cervas simply did not -- simply did
266=                not create the maps that show that his testimony will be
267=                trustworthy here because he did not understand many
268=                aspects, as gone through in the motion in limine, of what
269=                the standards are in Tennessee.
270=                                   Additionally, as Your Honors know, we
271=                went through this -- the motion for evidentiary sanctions
272=                and the issues within overriding a map that was in the
273=                record, without telling anyone.  And if that was not
274=                pointed out, that map would have -- a map that was not
275=                produced during discovery, that was not produced by the
276=                discovery deadlines laid out by this Court in their
277=                discovery scheduling order, that map would have ultimately
278=                been -- you know, whether it was an intent or not, snuck
279=                into the record to where we would have had a very serious
280=                issue there.
281=                                   So, ultimately, we move for the
282=                exclusion of Dr. Cervas's testimony in whole.  We believe
283=                it's neither trustworthy, nor will assist the trier of
284=                fact.
285=                                   And I'm happy to answer any questions

fmt=pb
287=                on that motion in limine, as they may arise.
288=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  No questions from me.
289=                                   MR. TIFT:  Thank you, Your Honors, and
290=                good morning.  Scott Tift on behalf of the plaintiffs.
291=                                   Motion in Limine Number 1 should be
292=                denied.  First off, we don't really understand why it was
293=                filed because it's duplicative of the already-pending
294=                motion from March 7th, often copying the exact same
295=                language in block.  But we're here on this issue again,
296=                and there's a few important points.
297=                                   There's no question that Dr. Cervas is
298=                qualified.  They don't challenge his qualifications.  He
299=                has been the primary mapmaker for four statewide
300=                redistricting maps; two in New York, two in Pennsylvania.
301=                                   He's been the assistant to the special
302=                master under three different Courts, drawing the maps for
303=                three different parts, subparts, or full parts of states
304=                in previous litigation.
305=                                   He's got a PhD in political and U.S.
306=                politics, teaches a class that discusses redistricting,
307=                has peer-reviewed papers on redistricting.  And, of
308=                course, his real-life experience.
309=                                   He's certainly qualified under the
310=                standards set forth in our rules to supply opinions on
311=                that based on his experience.  And so that's Point 1.
312=                                       (615) 400-3673                    10
fmt=pb
313=                                   The second, you know, the reason -- we
314=                submit the Court should hear all of the parties' expert
315=                witnesses, and the Court can decide what's persuasive or
316=                not, based on the full testimony.  I think what you just
317=                heard from opposing counsel is a great example of this.
318=                                   For instance, you were just told
319=                Dr. Cervas didn't read any Tennessee cases.  Maybe that
320=                sounds like a problem in isolation.  But what Dr. Cervas
321=                told these same counsel during his deposition is what he
322=                used to get up on the law is called the National
323=                Conference of State Legislators red book, a book that
324=                Mr. Himes, their expert, writes chapters for and is
325=                well-regarded as one of the leading redistricting
326=                documents or compendiums out there.
327=                                   So Dr. Cervas testified -- he didn't
328=                testify, "I don't know anything about Tennessee law."
329=                                   He testified that, "I read the NCSL red
330=                book on the issues at hand.  He also has broad knowledge
331=                with previous experience about the federal overlays on
332=                redistricting, whether that's one-person, one-vote,
333=                minority-majority district, Voting Rights Act, all of
334=                those issues.
335=                                   And, of course, he's working under
336=                Counsel, who he puts in his report, advised him on what
337=                his assignment was.  And his assignment involved

339=                determining whether or not fewer counties could have been
340=                split under the 2020 demographics, while keeping the
341=                variance under 10 percent, which is sort of a break point
342=                in the one-person, one-vote litigation, and while still
343=                complying with federal constitutional law.
344=                                   So he's also been advised on the law
345=                that he's speaking on by Counsel in this case.  So the
346=                idea that he's not aware and just working in a vacuum is
347=                not accurate.  It's a choice cherry-pick from a
348=                deposition.
349=                                   The same is true on non-contiguities.
350=                There's a few issues with their non-contiguity argument.
351=                                   One is Defendants never acknowledged
352=                the fact that Dr. Cervas, when they've identified
353=                non-contiguities, has then gone back and done errata
354=                versions to fix these non-contiguities.
355=                                   But, also, it's important to note that
356=                their own -- you know, Dr. Cervas used a program called
357=                Dave's Redistricting app.  It's the same program that
358=                their other expert, Sean Trende, used when redistricting
359=                the whole state of Virginia as a special master under the
360=                Court there.  And it's a program that Mr. Himes testifies
361=                in his deposition has troubles recognizing small
362=                non-contiguities.
363=                                   So the program has a problem with
364=                                       (615) 400-3673                    12
fmt=pb
365=                finding some non-contiguities.  And what we're talking
366=                about in almost all cases is a census block, the tiniest
367=                bit of a state with zero people in it.
368=                                   So you've got -- one of them, he'll
369=                testify, is in a lake.  So in the middle of a lake is
370=                noncontiguous.  And as soon as Mr. Himes runs the program
371=                through Maptitude -- which is better at finding
372=                non-contiguities -- Dr. Cervas is able to pair them up.
373=                                   And, notably, it doesn't change the
374=                analysis at all or the weight of these maps at all.
375=                                   For instance, if a map has a certain
376=                number of splits and a certain percentage total variance,
377=                two very key details here, putting a zero population
378=                census block slightly to the left and to the right changes
379=                the variance not at all.  It changes the county splits not
380=                at all.
381=                                   There's one 11-person non-contiguity.
382=                Fixing that one neither changes any county splits, nor
383=                changes the total variance of the plan.
384=                                   So what you're really hearing here is
385=                criticism, substantive criticisms of what Dr. Cervas has
386=                done, couched in the language of disqualifying
387=                untruthfulness.  It's not untruthfulness.  They can make
388=                those criticisms -- I'm sure they will -- on the stand.
389=                But substantive criticisms of a qualified expert should be

fmt=pb
391=                aired through direct and cross-examination and not couched
392=                in indicia of untruthfulness.
393=                                   And, finally, we've discussed the issue
394=                of the maps and the inadvertent error that Dr. Cervas made
395=                when he went to see if he could fix a non-contiguity, and
396=                failed to save a duplicate copy, so that for a little
397=                while, the actual link pointed to a different map.
398=                                   Now, both sides, as you heard on March
399=                the 7th, have the original data underlying all of the maps
400=                that are before the Court.  The original data are called
401=                shapefiles, Block Assignment Files.  Dr. Cervas has them
402=                on his computer, and Mr. Himes said in open court during
403=                summary judgment that he has them on his computer.  He
404=                also said in his deposition that the way he analyzes the
405=                maps is downloads the shapefiles to his program.
406=                                   So, first off, nothing's been
407=                destroyed.  Also, no primary evidence has been destroyed.
408=                It's an expert's testimony that we're talking about.
409=                                   And then the map that he made for his
410=                own, figured out he could fix those non-contiguities, from
411=                day one, Plaintiffs have said, "We have no intention of
412=                using that map at trial."
413=                                   I don't know why they would want to use
414=                that map at trial.  So if this were to hinge on, you know,
415=                his extra map that he made not being in the record, I
416=                                       (615) 400-3673                    14
fmt=pb
417=                mean, we can publish it.  We don't want to use it.  They
418=                don't want to use it.  So I don't see how that would be an
419=                issue.
420=                                   But what fundamentally has not happened
421=                is any destruction of these underlying files.  But also
422=                what's notable here is that Dr. Cervas has excerpted and
423=                analyzed all of his maps in his report.  Mr. Himes has
424=                done his own analyses of those maps.  And they're going to
425=                get here and testify about those maps, based on their
426=                analyses of them.
427=                                   Nothing has changed in their reports.
428=                Nothing is going to change in Mr. Himes's response to
429=                Dr. Cervas's testimony about what any given map has, in
430=                terms of variances and things along those lines.
431=                                   So this is all a bunch of, you know,
432=                throwing up smoke to make it look like, all of a sudden,
433=                nobody knows what's going on.  But everybody knows what
434=                these maps are.  Everybody has the files of these maps.
435=                Both sides have reviewed these maps, and both sides are
436=                ready to support and criticize the maps, respectively, in
437=                front of you.
438=                                   And so we submit the way that -- the
439=                proper ruling here is to deny Motion in Limine 1.
440=                There's -- you've got a qualified witness that they have
441=                substantive criticisms of.  They should certainly be able
442=                                       (615) 400-3673                    15
fmt=pb
443=                to air those criticisms.
444=                                   But what shouldn't happen is the expert
445=                being excluded or his final map being -- you know, not
446=                being allowed to see the light of day because of a claim
447=                that he somehow destroyed the files, which didn't happen,
448=                and which they do have.
449=                                   And as a final point, though Counsel
450=                didn't just say it, there's a suggestion of that his final
451=                map produced over three years ago was, you know, trial by
452=                ambush.  And, of course, we would submit to the Court that
453=                here at trial Dr. Cervas, on cross or in rebuttal, is
454=                certainly capable and even expected to respond --
455=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  I think he said three
456=                years ago.
457=                                   MR. TIFT:  Well -- and that's certainly
458=                not true.  Thank you for the correction.  Three months
459=                ago.
460=                                   But, you know, here today, Dr. Cervas
461=                will be -- or tomorrow, whenever he does -- will be
462=                allowed, during cross and redirect, to respond to novel
463=                criticisms.
464=                                   When there was a novel criticism stated
465=                in their expert witness's deposition, rather than waiting
466=                three months later to address it at trial, three days
467=                later he supplied the final map, which is his substantive
468=                                       (615) 400-3673                    16
fmt=pb
469=                response.
470=                                   So we'd submit there's no reason for
471=                denying in Motion in Limine 1 and that the Court should
472=                create, you know, the best record we can have here by
473=                having all of the experts testify and weighing what was
474=                persuasive and what wasn't.
475=                                   Thank you.
476=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Brief rebuttal.
477=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Just a couple of brief
478=                points on this.
479=                                   First one is, you know, not reading the
480=                case law, but looking at the red book.  I've got a copy of
481=                the red book.  You know what word never appears in it?
482=                Lockert.  Or Rural West Tennessee.  You can't understand
483=                Tennessee redistricting without understanding Lockert or
484=                Rural West Tennessee.
485=                                   There are a number of criteria that
486=                Dr. Cervas used, like in his reports, like compactness,
487=                mean deviation, total splits of counties, coalition
488=                majority-minority districts.  None of these criteria have
489=                ever been substantively considered in any Tennessee
490=                redistricting case.
491=                                   Coalition on majority-minority
492=                districts are actually not only disfavored, they are
493=                considered not actionable by the Sixth Circuit.  The Sixth
494=                                       (615) 400-3673                    17
fmt=pb
495=                Circuit does not recognize coalition majority-minority
496=                districts at all.
497=                                   Once again, if you don't understand the
498=                criteria here, you can't draw a map.  This is a very hard
499=                process.  But no map can be made legal if you don't
500=                understand what those standards are.
501=                                   Additionally, you know, their expert
502=                used, in one of his affidavits, words to describe Dave's
503=                Redistricting as a persistent software flaw related to
504=                non-contiguity.  He had four rounds, where this persistent
505=                software flaw kept tripping him up.
506=                                   The problem is, he also put in his
507=                report that he had a license to Maptitude, the exact
508=                software that Mr. Himes used the entire time to create the
509=                enacted map that has no contiguity issues.
510=                                   The thing is, he had a tool.  If he
511=                thought there was a persistent flaw, he had another tool
512=                he could have found this out.  He didn't.
513=                                   And we'll also get to the fact later
514=                on, though, if we get there, that all it takes to find a
515=                non-contiguity in Dave's Redistricting is two mouse
516=                clicks.  There's a tool to find them.
517=                                   Finally, they say that 11 people left
518=                out of a map for noncontiguous reasons is somehow, you
519=                know, okay.  There's only one plaintiff here.  That's 11
520=                                       (615) 400-3673                    18
fmt=pb
521=                potential plaintiffs, if they're in a noncontiguous
522=                district.  I mean, it certainly matters to those 11 people
523=                probably to be in a district that's legal.
524=                                   Ultimately, the whole record here shows
525=                this goes beyond substantive criticism.  This comes to the
526=                basic competence and testimony and trustworthiness of
527=                their expert.
528=                                   We believe that his testimony should be
529=                denied for the reasons that are mentioned.  And, again,
530=                happy to answer any questions that the Court may have.
531=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
532=                                   Motion Number 2.
533=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Good morning, Your
534=                Honors.  This motion is a motion in limine to exclude any
535=                redistricting criteria that are either not one of the
536=                house factors listed in the statute they passed or that
537=                the house redistricting committee considered or any that
538=                are not in Tennessee law.  And I mentioned them briefly.
539=                                   Dr. Cervas, in his reports, mentioned
540=                compactness.  Mean deviation, instead of overall
541=                deviation.  Mean deviation is also average deviation.
542=                Total splits of counties, instead of the -- if a county is
543=                split once, that counts as one split, as we usually
544=                consider in Tennessee law.  And coalition
545=                majority-minority districts.

547=                                   Again, redistricting is complicated
548=                enough, just off the criteria that's considered under
549=                Tennessee law.  If we have experts getting up here and
550=                talking about all these things, which may be fair
551=                considerations in other states, but aren't considered here
552=                in Tennessee, we just run the risk of adding additional
553=                burdens here, additional confusion, and, quite frankly,
554=                it's a waste of time.
555=                                   We'd like these excluded because they
556=                just aren't considered in Tennessee law.  They weren't
557=                considered by the House.  And they are not determinative
558=                to whether the enacted house map is legal or not.
559=                                   You know, we can go through all the
560=                compactness and all these, you know, mathematical
561=                precision measures, but they don't determine the law here.
562=                                   We can talk about mean deviation.  It's
563=                not a consideration of the law.  Overall deviation is what
564=                matters.
565=                                   Total splits, completely irrelevant
566=                here.
567=                                   And, again, the coalition
568=                majority-minority districts that Dr. Cervas actually cited
569=                in some of his reports, Sixth Circuit case law is very
570=                clear.  Majority-minority districts cannot be considered
571=                under the Voting Rights Act by adding a coalition of
572=                                       (615) 400-3673                    20
fmt=pb
573=                district minorities from, you know, different racial
574=                categories or ethnic categories.
575=                                   Again, these are irrelevant.  They will
576=                not help the Court here to make the determinations that it
577=                must.  And we would like them excluded because it, quite
578=                frankly, will just help us focus on the issues that the
579=                law actually turns on here.
580=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
581=                                   MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, I'll be brief
582=                because the same issue is here.
583=                                   There's no reason why the Court can't
584=                hear an expert use the terminology of his trade, and then
585=                sort through, under the crucible of cross-examination of
586=                post-trial briefs, if some portion of it is somehow
587=                irrelevant to the specific crux of the issue.  And, you
588=                know, walking through these, it's demonstrated why that is
589=                clear.
590=                                   I mean, the first, compactness.
591=                Compactness is used in 40 states, as Mr. Himes recognizes.
592=                And Doug Himes has criticized Dr. Cervas's maps for the
593=                converse of compactness, which is bizarre shape districts.
594=                You know, our federal courts have walked through the fact
595=                that bizarre shape is a way of determining the compactness
596=                of a district.
597=                                   So, you know, that's a very frequently
598=                                       (615) 400-3673                    21
fmt=pb
599=                used term.  He's criticizing the maps through,
600=                essentially, a lack of compactness, which is reflected in
601=                a bizarre shape.  And, you know, worst case scenario, if
602=                the Court hears the expert, you know, we're not here on a
603=                jury trial.  If the Court hears him talk about compactness
604=                and that's not compelling, that's fine.  It's not
605=                persuasive, if that's the case.
606=                                   Average deviation has been recognized
607=                by the United State Supreme Court as a redistricting
608=                metric since 1973 and in cases since.  So to suggest that
609=                you can't even talk about something that the United State
610=                Supreme Court recognizes as a redistricting metric, when,
611=                again, we're in front of a bench trial here, it just
612=                doesn't hold water.
613=                                   And, finally, on the coalition
614=                districts.  Coalition districts are part of overall voting
615=                rights considerations.  I assume that's why Mr. Himes, and
616=                regularly throughout his testimony to the house
617=                subcommittees and the committees, talked about how the
618=                enacted map itself has two coalition districts, in
619=                addition to the 13 majority-minority districts.
620=                                   You know, he was touting that as one of
621=                the many -- you know, as he was explaining the
622=                constitutionality of that document.  So why that's
623=                relevant in briefing the people who are actually enacting
624=                                       (615) 400-3673                    22
fmt=pb
625=                the bill, but can't be even stated here by Dr. Cervas,
626=                when, again, it is part of an overall analysis of the
627=                dilution of racial votes and everything like that, you
628=                know, the Court can sort through that.  He shouldn't be
629=                limited from testifying about it.
630=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
631=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Yeah.  Again, this trial
632=                should be about what the legal standards are, not what may
633=                be good for a map in some hypothetical world, where we're
634=                going beyond what the law requires.
635=                                   You know, Mr. Himes did, in his
636=                testimony, talk about opportunity districts.  Opportunity
637=                districts are not necessarily coalition majority-minority
638=                districts, additionally.  If he says that they're good,
639=                that doesn't mean it's a legal standard.  It might be
640=                something nice to say, "Hey, this map also has these
641=                features that people may like or not like."
642=                                   But, again, we're here focused on the
643=                legal standards.
644=                                   Again, total splits are irrelevant.  It
645=                is confusing, with the understanding of county splits as
646=                they're used in Tennessee law.
647=                                   Again, the Court -- you know, the
648=                Supreme Court may have mentioned mean deviations
649=                somewhere.  There's no legal requirement related to the
650=                                       (615) 400-3673                    23
fmt=pb
651=                average deviation of districts.
652=                                   When we talk about population
653=                deviation, one-person, one-vote, we're talking about
654=                overall deviation.
655=                                   And, finally, on compactness, again,
656=                you know, the bizarre shapes, yeah, I mean, it's --
657=                obviously, it's a bizarre shape, and it just doesn't quite
658=                pass the smell test sometimes.  But, again, not a legal
659=                requirement here.
660=                                   So we should stay focused on the issues
661=                that this case will turn on, not go into a
662=                how-to-draw-a-map class and get off subject of what we
663=                need to focus on here because it will only just delay the
664=                trial longer, and we want to be respectful of the Court's
665=                time.
666=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
667=                                   Motion Number 3.
668=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Good morning, Your Honors.
669=                Alex Rieger from the Attorney General's Office, here on
670=                behalf of Defendants.
671=                                   Our Motion in Limine Number 3 is to
672=                exclude all evidence and testimony that's unrelated to the
673=                split of Gibson County.
674=                                   It is our contention that any evidence
675=                besides relating to the split of Gibson County is
676=                                       (615) 400-3673                    24
fmt=pb
677=                irrelevant because you don't have a plaintiff to attach it
678=                to.
679=                                   Mr. Wygant is the last plaintiff left
680=                for the house map.  It's undisputed that Ms. Hunt lives in
681=                Davidson County, which is not a split county.
682=                                   The Court -- in its order on summary
683=                judgment, as to Ms. Turner, who was a former plaintiff in
684=                this case, the Court got that absolutely right.  It found
685=                that because she did not live in a split county, under
686=                United States versus Hayes, she asserted only a
687=                generalized grievance that was insufficient to show harm.
688=                                   What this means is that in Tennessee,
689=                the right to vote belongs to individual citizens and
690=                individual citizens by themselves, in isolation.  It's an
691=                individual right.
692=                                   Mr. Wygant lives in Gibson County.  If,
693=                say, for instance, Anderson County was split.  Mr. Wygant
694=                does not live in Anderson County.  He is not harmed by the
695=                split of Anderson County.  He can only be harmed if his
696=                allegations are true that the split is unconstitutional,
697=                and, of course, we vigorously contest that.  But his harm
698=                originates only from the split of Gibson County.  And that
699=                is the only thing that he may challenge here, under Gill
700=                versus Whitford and Baker versus Carr.
701=                                   Now, Plaintiffs in this case have said,
702=                                       (615) 400-3673                    25
fmt=pb
703=page   
704=                "Well, this is the type of piecemeal attack that is
705=                disfavored, in Lincoln County -- that the Supreme Court
706=                said was disfavored, Lincoln County versus Crowell."
707=                                   To be fair, the defendants did not make
708=                that problem.  Plaintiffs are masters of their complaint.
709=                They proceeded to go with only one plaintiff in the House.
710=                                   Compared to the Lockert cases, where
711=                Lockert 1, 2, and 3, it was the State of Tennessee, ex
712=                rel., Lockert.  And, of course, the State of Tennessee has
713=                statewide standing.  Here, Mr. Wygant does not.
714=                                   And just like the federal Voting Rights
715=                Act cases, they have to proceed district by district,
716=                which means that if you are alleging noncompliance with
717=                the VRA, you have to live in that district.  You can't
718=                say, "Well, I live in District 3 and I'm challenging
719=                because District 4 is violates the VRA."
720=                                   We know, in the case of Alabama
721=                Legislative Black Caucus versus Alabama that that doesn't
722=                work.  You have to live there, and then your entire scope
723=                is focused on whether or not the district where you live
724=                is unconstitutional.
725=                                   And one more thing in Gill -- and I'll
726=                be brief.  It is somewhat difficult because the remedy --
727=                of course, if there was an unconstitutional split, the
728=                remedy would be a statewide redrawing of the map.  It
729=                                       (615) 400-3673                    26
fmt=pb
730=                would have to be.
731=                                   But that does not mean that the remedy
732=                works backwards into the injury for the purposes of
733=                standing.  Standing does not look at the remedy in
734=                redressability.  Standing only starts by looking at the
735=                injury.  And we know that because the United States
736=                Supreme Court told us that in Gill, when it said:  The
737=                plaintiffs' mistaken insistence of the claims in Baker and
738=                Reynolds versus Sims were statewide in nature rests on a
739=                failure to distinguish injury from remedy.
740=                                   And that's what Plaintiffs are trying
741=                to get this Court to do.  They're trying to get the Court
742=                to confuse remedy with injury.
743=                                   Here, Mr. Wygant has only one injury,
744=                and that is the alleged unconstitutional split of Gibson
745=                County.  His proof should be limited to that, and the
746=                Court should do for Mr. Wygant and for Plaintiffs exactly
747=                what it did for Plaintiff Turner when she was still in
748=                this case, which is to acknowledge that a plaintiff only
749=                has standing to attack the district and the county they
750=                live in.
751=                                   And for that reason, we are asking that
752=                this Court exclude all the testimony and evidence that's
753=                unrelated to the split of Gibson County.  Thank you.

755=                                       (615) 400-3673                    27

756=                Number 3 is asking the Court -- it's trying to do an end
757=                run around the decisions this Court has already reached,
758=                which is that Mr. Wygant, in a divided county, has
759=                standing to bring claims.  And the Supreme Court has
760=                provided us with what happens in that case.
761=                                   The Tennessee Supreme Court has said
762=                that when an individual plaintiff has standing to bring
763=                these claims, or when plaintiffs have brought these
764=                claims, so long as the individual plaintiff proves that at
765=                least one county was divided, the burden shifts to
766=                defendants.  And the burden through three decades of cases
767=                has not been, "All right.  So the burden shifts to the
768=                defendants to prove that the specific county where the
769=                plaintiff lives is where -- is improperly divided."
770=                                   That would make no sense because these
771=                are -- you know, these types of cases where the standard
772=                is to have the fewest divides necessary to comply with the
773=                federal constitution involves looking at the entire
774=                puzzle.
775=                                   And so the standard, once a plaintiff
776=                has established standing, is for the defendants -- state
777=                defendants to demonstrate that the map is justified
778=                because it crosses minds only as necessary to meet to
779=                comply with the federal constitution.  That is a statewide
780=                look at the map because there's no way to look at just one
781=                                       (615) 400-3673                    28
fmt=pb
782=                piece of the puzzle without looking at the rest of the
783=                map.
784=                                   It actually is like Baker v. Carr and
785=                not like Gill.  There were not plaintiffs in all 95
786=                counties of Tennessee in Baker v. Carr.  There were
787=                plaintiffs in a subset of counties.  I'm not aware of
788=                exactly who they were.  But there certainly weren't 95
789=                counties.  And the issue there was they had standing from
790=                their district, but the remedy was statewide.  The same
791=                thing is true here.
792=                                   Mr. Wygant, as the Court has
793=                determined, has had his constitutional right to have his
794=                county not divided violated.  Now, the burden switches to
795=                the defendants to demonstrate that the map, in fact,
796=                divided as few as possible.  And if they don't meet that
797=                burden, the remedy is, as Mr. Rieger just stated, a
798=                statewide redoing of the map.
799=                                   So that's the burden before us.  We're
800=                not in a Voting Rights Act case.  The Voting Rights Act
801=                case, we don't disagree with Mr. Rieger that that's how
802=                those cases fall down.
803=                                   This is one where once a plaintiff with
804=                standing demonstrates the county has been divided, the map
805=                as a whole has to be analyzed to determine if as few
806=                counties were divided as possible.
807=                                       (615) 400-3673                    29
fmt=pb
808=                                   And that makes a lot of sense.  I mean,
809=                if the Court were to rule that testimony could only be
810=                provided about Gibson County, that would lead us to sort
811=                of an -- almost a farcical hearing, where there's no way
812=                to say if your specific county did or didn't need to be
813=                divided, when you can't look at any other piece of the
814=                puzzle at all.
815=                                   I mean, it's like a traffic accident
816=                case with ten cars, saying, "Well, we can only talk about
817=                this one car and not how many of the other cars affected,
818=                and not how they interacted."
819=                                   There would be no way to focus just on
820=                Gibson County alone, blocking off the entire rest of this
821=                state, and even prove anything just about Gibson County,
822=                much less follow the burden that has been given to us by
823=                courts for the defendants to demonstrate that the map
824=                itself crosses as few county lines as possible.
825=                                   And Defendants, multiple times
826=                throughout our briefing over the last few months, are fond
827=                of saying that we agree to something or that we agree --
828=                that we have taken the position and agreed with them on
829=                something.
830=                                   Here, they say that we agree that this
831=                is a piecemeal attack.  Of course, we don't agree this is
832=                a piecemeal attack.  What we said in our response is that
833=                                       (615) 400-3673                    30
fmt=pb
834=                they're trying, through an evidentiary motion, to take a
835=                case that is, in fact, a fascial challenge to the map and
836=                say, "You need to turn it into a piecemeal attack."
837=                                   And then they're logging on or
838=                connecting to the Lincoln County standard, where if a map
839=                has been justified by Defendants first, then Plaintiffs
840=                would have to prove bad faith.
841=                                   Again, we looked at this several times
842=                along the way.  But Lincoln County came at the end of the
843=                three Lockert cases and a federal court case, where, at
844=                that point, the state court and the federal court had
845=                justified the remedial map put in place and validated it.
846=                And then Lincoln County, by itself, brought a claim
847=                challenging expressly only Lincoln County.
848=                                   And on that ground, the Supreme Court
849=                said, "Since the map has already been justified by both
850=                our court's guidance and the federal court's guidance, to
851=                overturn just Lincoln County's divide would require bad
852=                faith."
853=                                   So we certainly do not agree this is a
854=                piecemeal attack.  It's not.  This is a fascial challenge
855=                to the statute.  And it is one where evidence should come
856=                in about the whole state because that is the burden set by
857=                our Supreme Court.
858=                                   The burden by our Supreme Court, at
859=                                       (615) 400-3673                    31
fmt=pb
860=                this stage, where the counties are divided, is for the
861=                defendants to demonstrate that as few counties as
862=                necessary were divided to comply with the federal or
863=                constitutional requirements.
864=                                   And the final point, Defendants point
865=                out that the Lockert cases were ex rel. cases brought on
866=                behalf of the State.  Well, the Rural West case lines were
867=                not.  And the Rural West cases allowed voters to overturn
868=                a statewide map, taking it from 30 divides to 28 divides.
869=                And the Moore case, two decades later, was also not an ex
870=                rel. case, and the Court there did not limit to just
871=                determining if Shelby County was the -- was, in fact, in
872=                violation.  The Court determined that the entire map was
873=                justified and constitutional.
874=                                   So focusing just on the ex rel.
875=                mechanism of Lockert also doesn't get you to a place where
876=                the burden stated by our Supreme Court doesn't apply and
877=                where, all of a sudden, burden borrowed from other types
878=                of redistricting cases becomes applicable.
879=                                   So we would ask that the motion be
880=                denied.
881=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Just a few extra points.
882=                                   First, we acknowledge that the Court in
883=                its summary judgment motion found that Mr. Wygant has
884=                standing.  And summary judgment as to that claim can't be
885=                                       (615) 400-3673                    32
fmt=pb
886=                retested here.  It would have to be something for appeal,
887=                since they've already received judgment on the claim of
888=                standing with Mr. Wygant.
889=                                   What the motion is about is what
890=                standing limits.  And standing -- Mr. Wygant's standing is
891=                a limitation upon his claim.
892=                                   Now, we're not saying that we can't
893=                leave Gibson County if information is relevant to whether
894=                or not Gibson County was constitutionally or
895=                unconstitutionally split.
896=                                   Certainly, looking at surrounding
897=                counties, the population pressures, the existence of
898=                majority-minority districts that would have to be
899=                maintained, all of that window can certainly be considered
900=                because it will have pressure on Gibson County.  It will
901=                help illuminate the reasons why Gibson County was split.
902=                                   However, to go beyond that and to point
903=                and say that -- the Tri-Cities counties and say that
904=                creates pressure on Gibson County, well, Mr. Wygant is not
905=                affected by anything out there.  It's on the other end of
906=                the state.  And it's, frankly, irrelevant to his claims.
907=                                   Again, he is a single voter.  He is not
908=                voters.  He is not challenging multiple counties.  He has
909=                one injury, and that's the allegation that Gibson County
910=                was split.  If the split of Gibson County is ultimately
911=                                       (615) 400-3673                    33
fmt=pb
912=                determined to be constitutional, his claim should end
913=                there.  Because the only thing that he would have standing
914=                to challenge has been declared not unconstitutional.
915=                                   And for that reason, we're asking that
916=                this Court exclude all testimony and evidence that is
917=                unrelated to Gibson County.  And that does not mean isn't
918=                completely focused on the split of Gibson County, but that
919=                does not impact the question, and the question that
920=                Mr. Wygant only has standing to raise, which is:  Was
921=                Gibson County unconstitutionally split?
922=                                   Thank you, Your Honors.
923=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
924=                                   Motion Number 4.
925=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, this motion
926=                in limine is about excluding any maps, boards, or
927=                testimony related thereto of any maps not disclosed by the
928=                plaintiffs to the defendants on or before December 2nd of
929=                2022.
930=                                   We believe that the agreed discovery
931=                scheduling order entered by this Court was abundantly
932=                clear.  Ultimately, you know, this expert discovery
933=                process followed a familiar pattern.  Plaintiffs disclosed
934=                their expert, filed a report.  Defendants then did the
935=                same.  We had expert depositions.  And there were
936=                deadlines for this.
937=                                       (615) 400-3673                    34
fmt=pb
938=                                   The agreed discovery scheduling order
939=                said expert rebuttal reports were due December 2nd of
940=                2022, and then expert depositions were completed, by
941=                agreement of the parties, by January 4th.
942=                                   Then five days later, and a mere 11
943=                days before summary judgment motion were due, there's
944=                another report that was filed by Plaintiffs of Dr. Cervas.
945=                This represented his fifth and final report in this case.
946=                                   And, ultimately, what we have here is a
947=                situation where Plaintiffs keep trying go back and get
948=                another opportunity to draw another map, another map,
949=                another map.  And we think that the scheduling order was
950=                very clear.
951=                                   You know, we would think the Court is
952=                well within its authority to take control of its docket
953=                and to exclude this untimely report.  Because, ultimately,
954=                you know, if this whole process just means that their
955=                expert gets to constantly go back and try to redraw and
956=                redraw again and again and again, I mean, eventually, even
957=                a blind squirrel finds an acorn every once in a while.
958=                                   But that's not necessarily fair
959=                because, keep in mind, this map was enacted and all these
960=                maps have been post hoc.  So if we sit around for months
961=                and months and months and try to come up with a slightly
962=                better map that somehow comes in, I mean, that's not what
963=                                       (615) 400-3673                    35

964=                the redistricting cases have spoke for.
965=                                   But, ultimately, this comes down to an
966=                issue of a scheduling order, and the Court's order here,
967=                and the wording of that order was not adhered to.
968=                                   There's also language in that
969=                scheduling order that specifically points to any
970=                supplemental reports that were not timely disclosed may be
971=                stricken.  And we think this is well within the Court's
972=                authority here and their discretion to strike the untimely
973=                report on January 9th.
974=                                   Not to mention any mention of any maps
975=                that have not been disclosed that may be brought up at
976=                trial that haven't been shown yet.  And that includes the
977=                map that was created after summary judgment was filed that
978=                was inadvertently placed into the record by overriding the
979=                map that was disclosed in the supplemental report.
980=                                   So, ultimately, you know, it would be
981=                trial by ambush if new maps suddenly showed up here.  And
982=                we think the Court should take control of the docket.
983=                And, clearly, that is not the intent of the scheduling
984=                order.
985=                                   So we would ask that the Court not
986=                allow any maps or testimony related to maps that were not
987=                disclosed by December 2nd, for those reasons.
988=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.

fmt=pb
990=                                   MR. TIFT:  Your Honors, I don't think
991=                that anybody disagrees that the Court is fully in charge
992=                of what it can allow and not allow under its records.  And
993=                I do think that it would make no sense, in the context of
994=                this lawsuit, to strike an expert's response to
995=                newly-lodged accusations from a deposition that took place
996=                after the expert rendered his opinion.  And let me walk
997=                through why.
998=                                   First off, there is no prejudice here.
999=                The prejudice would be -- is made up.  I mean, there's no
1000=                prejudice because three days -- business days after their
1001=                final expert witness testified to new concerns about one
1002=                of Dr. Cervas's maps, Plaintiffs produced a response to
1003=                that testimony with one map addressing the two specific
1004=                criticisms stated:  This is in response to the criticisms
1005=                raised in your expert's testimony.  Dr. Cervas can
1006=                certainly be made available for additional deposition on
1007=                this map.
1008=                                   And Defendants chose not to do so, and
1009=                now say that it's trial by ambush to have produced that
1010=                map then.  Whereas, if that map hadn't been produced then,
1011=                then later today or tomorrow, Your Honors would be hearing
1012=                Dr. Cervas be cross-examined by these lawyers to say,
1013=                "Well, this map, 13D, has these two issues, doesn't it,
1014=                sir?"
1015=                                       (615) 400-3673                    37
fmt=pb
1016=                                   And then in either his response on
1017=                cross or -- or on direct, he would be well within his
1018=                right to respond to those criticisms and to show how he
1019=                would fix those criticisms.  But he's not all of a sudden
1020=                not allowed to defend himself against attack because a
1021=                scheduling deadline has passed.
1022=                                   And it would be our suggestion that
1023=                proffering that response three days after the depos and
1024=                three months before trial is the opposite of trial by
1025=                ambush.  They've now had three months to respond to this
1026=                one additional map.  They have substantively responded to
1027=                it.  They had their expert, Mr. Himes, analyze it, put
1028=                together a new analysis.  And they substantively
1029=                challenged that map in their summary judgment motion.
1030=                                   So they certainly haven't been
1031=                ambushed.  The question is, really, what it comes down to
1032=                here is their concern that this was produced after the
1033=                deadline.  And for that, you know, we don't disagree.  I
1034=                mean, it is noted -- or it should be noted that the only
1035=                reason it was two weeks before summary judgment is because
1036=                their witness took two months to schedule, and we often
1037=                always extend courtesies to the witnesses, and we extended
1038=                the schedule because their expert couldn't testify until
1039=                January.  And so the proximity to summary judgment is
1040=                particularly irrelevant here.
1041=                                       (615) 400-3673                    38
fmt=pb
1042=                                   But, yes, it was certainly after the
1043=                deadline, but promptly after new criticism that was raised
1044=                after the deadline, and as far away from trial as possible
1045=                to ensure that his response to that criticism is not a
1046=                trial by ambush.
1047=                                   So we would say it's well within the
1048=                Court's discretion to manage the documents before it and
1049=                to say, in the interest of justice, in the interest of
1050=                getting this right, in the interest of seeing what is the
1051=                actual response to this criticism, we shall allow this map
1052=                in.
1053=                                   And, of course, if the Court excludes
1054=                it, he can certainly testify about how he would fix the
1055=                issues that they've raised.  Those are criticisms they are
1056=                raising, and he has every right in demonstrating to the
1057=                Court that those are valid maps, despite the criticism of
1058=                explaining to the Court how so.
1059=                                   So it would be much clearer before the
1060=                Court, and certainly there is no ambush or prejudice here
1061=                for him to -- instead of talking through into the --
1062=                without any visual, how he would fix the issues to be able
1063=                to let him actually show you on the map how he fixed them.
1064=                                   Thank you, Your Honors.
1065=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
1066=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, let's be
1067=                                       (615) 400-3673                    39
fmt=pb
1068=                clear.  They violated an order of this Court by not
1069=                disclosing that supplement report timely.  Point-blank.
1070=                                   Additionally, I would just say notice
1071=                how many of these motion in limines are about Dr. Cervas
1072=                due to his sloppiness here in this case.
1073=                                   Ultimately, just throwing up a new map
1074=                at trial that our experts have never seen, that hasn't
1075=                gone through the crucible of discovery, would be ambush.
1076=                                   If there is one thing I think we can
1077=                all agree on is that redistricting is complex and it's
1078=                hard.  And even experts need to look at a map, do
1079=                mathematical analysis, go through a detailed process on
1080=                finding out every different criteria on this map.  Because
1081=                most criteria take its own specific targeted analysis.
1082=                                   And saying that there's -- either
1083=                drawing a map or showing a new map that our experts have
1084=                never seen, they can't be expected to give a full and
1085=                complete and accurate criticism on the fly of some new
1086=                map.
1087=                                   It takes the help of computer programs.
1088=                You have to analyze data, and you have to find different
1089=                percentages.  And in some cases, you have to go through
1090=                mathematical analysis, like regression analysis.  You have
1091=                to, in some cases, go through racially polarized voting
1092=                for Voting Rights Act analysis.
1093=                                       (615) 400-3673                    40
fmt=pb
1094=                                   These are complex processes that,
1095=                ultimately, you can't just do on the fly and you can't ask
1096=                an expert to do so.
1097=                                   So, again, for the reasons of -- and an
1098=                order of the Court was clearly violated.  And, again, any
1099=                maps that just show up here that haven't gone through
1100=                discovery, that weren't disclosed in the reports that the
1101=                Court's deadlines clearly gave for the experts, we just --
1102=                we think that's improper, and we would ask that the Court
1103=                exclude those.
1104=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you, sir.
1105=                                   Number 5.
1106=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, Motions in
1107=                Limine 5, 6, and 7 are preservation motions.  Under the
1108=                local rules of Davidson County, if you do not raise
1109=                deposition objections as part of a motion in limine, they
1110=                are waived.
1111=                                   I don't know that Your Honor would --
1112=                that Your Honors would want me to go through the entire
1113=                list for all three and have those ruled on now.
1114=                                   If I could make a suggestion, it would
1115=                be that if they come up -- since depositions are not
1116=                admissible evidence, they're only used for the purpose of
1117=                impeachment through prior inconsistent statements, that we
1118=                take them up -- each of the objections individually up if
1119=                                       (615) 400-3673                    41
fmt=pb
1120=                they come up.
1121=                                   And if the Court is fine with that,
1122=                then I think that would resolve 5, 6, and 7 by simply
1123=                noting that they're preserved.  And if they come up, we
1124=                can handle the objection there.
1125=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
1126=                                   We'll hear from the other side, and see
1127=                if you need to come back up here.
1128=                                   MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, that's,
1129=                essentially, what we said in our response.  Only used for
1130=                impeachment, presumably, if we first ask the question
1131=                live, they would raise the objection, you'll have already
1132=                ruled on it.  If we then need to impeach, it's probably
1133=                already been ruled on.  So we would say that it doesn't
1134=                make any sense to rule on them right now.
1135=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.  So we'll treat
1136=                that as something that's going to be reserved and taken up
1137=                on a case-by-case basis.
1138=                                   So we'll take a break.  We'll rule on
1139=                the motion -- we'll confer on the motion from -- that we
1140=                heard on March 7th, and then these first four motions in
1141=                limine, and come back and announce the rulings, and then
1142=                proceed with the proof.
1143=                                   I assume -- but I get in trouble when I
1144=                do that -- that the parties will rely on your pretrial
1145=                                       (615) 400-3673                    42
fmt=pb
1146=                briefs, instead of opening statements.  But we are fine
1147=                with hearing opening statements, if the parties so elect
1148=                to do so.
1149=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Defendants are fine with
1150=                that approach.
1151=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
1152=                                   MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, we had agreed
1153=                and put in the proposed order that we would do openings,
1154=                but limit them to 15 minutes.  And particularly since
1155=                Defendants raised a few new arguments in their pretrial
1156=                brief, we'd like to do the 15 minutes.
1157=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.  That's fine with
1158=                the Court.
1159=                                   MR. RIEGER:  That's fine with the
1160=                defendants.

1163=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  The panel, after
1164=                conferring, respectfully denies the motion to
1165=                disqualify -- I'm calling it that as shorthand -- filed in
1166=                January, heard in March, motion to strike.  Again, that is
1167=                a shorthand reference to a motion filed on February 22nd,
1168=                and heard on March 7th.  We deny those motions.
1169=                                   And we also deny Motions in Limine 1,
1170=                2, 3, and 4.
1171=                                       (615) 400-3673                    43
fmt=pb
1172=                                   Basically, some of these motions go to
1173=                the weight.  Some of these motions relate to potential
1174=                prejudice.  And we don't see any actual prejudice.
1175=                                   A question of spoliation of evidence
1176=                was raised.  But as we found out on March 7th, that does
1177=                not appear to be an actual spoliation.
1178=                                   We were concerned about the missing of
1179=                a deadline.  But in the grand scheme of things, it looks
1180=                like everyone's recovered and done a nice job, a great job
1181=                in briefing and getting ready for trial.
1182=                                   So we think we are just going to let
1183=                the lawyers try the case, and we'll see how it comes out.
1184=                                   So that's the Court's ruling on those.
1185=                                   We'll have opening statements.
1186=                                   MR. TIFT:  And one quick question, Your
1187=                Honor.  Would you like us, by agreement, to go ahead and
1188=                read in the numbers of the exhibits that we agree are
1189=                admitted, or would you like us to do that after the
1190=                opening?
1191=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Let's do the opening
1192=                first.
1193=                                   MR. RIEGER:  And I'm sorry, Your Honor.
1194=                When would you like for us to call for the rule?
1195=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Oh.  It makes sense to do
1196=                it now, I think.
1197=                                       (615) 400-3673                    44
fmt=pb
1198=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Okay.  The defendants
1199=                respectfully request the rule, please.
1200=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.  If there's anybody
1201=                in here who is expected to testify in this case and you
1202=                are not a party or a party representative, we're going to
1203=                ask you to step out of this courtroom, wait out in the
1204=                hall.
1205=                                   There is a vending area with seating
1206=                down the hall that you can wait.
1207=                                   You're not to discuss this case or your
1208=                testimony.  The only exception is that, on a break, if you
1209=                voluntarily want to talk to one of these lawyers, you may.
1210=                You don't have to.  But other than that, talk about the
1211=                weather, talk about what's happening with UT and Vandy and
1212=                all of that.  But please don't discuss your testimony or
1213=                the issues in this case.
1214=                                   So if somebody needs to be excused,
1215=                please be excused at this point.
1216=                                   MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, the only fact
1217=                witness outside of the party plaintiffs is Mr. Himes.  And
1218=                I believe it's an exception to the rule that testifying
1219=                experts are permitted to observe the trial and respond at
1220=                trial.  So we would ask that our testifying expert not be
1221=                excluded from the courtroom.
1222=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Any position on that?
1223=                                       (615) 400-3673                    45
fmt=pb
1224=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Are you seeking to have
1225=                Dr. Cervas remain?
1226=                                   MR. TIFT:  Correct.
1227=                                   MR. RIEGER:  No objection as to that.
1228=                                   As for Mr. Himes, our expert and fact
1229=                witness, who is going to be called by Plaintiffs, since he
1230=                is both a fact and an expert, we think that the rule would
1231=                apply to him.  But, regardless, I believe it's his choice
1232=                whether or not he wishes to remain in here or not.
1233=                                   But when do you think you're going to
1234=                call him in the order?
1235=                                   MR. TIFT:  After the two plaintiffs.
1236=                So it should be after the lunch break, I would assume.
1237=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Okay.  Thank you, Your
1238=                Honor.
1239=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  So is he to be excused?
1240=                Mr. Himes?
1241=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Yes.  I believe he would
1242=                need to be since he is a mixed fact and expert.
1243=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Sorry to see you go,
1244=                Mr. Himes.
1245=                                   MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, I'm just going
1246=                to set myself a timer on my phone here.  That's why I
1247=                brought my phone up here, so I don't go beyond the 15
1248=                minutes we agreed on here.
1249=                                       (615) 400-3673                    46
fmt=pb
1250=                                   Well, Your Honors, again, may it please
1251=                the Court, and, again, good morning.
1252=                                   You're going to hear and have heard
1253=                that redistricting is a complex process.  But this lawsuit
1254=                is not complex.
1255=                                   In many cases, there's lots of claims,
1256=                lots of things going on.  But, here, there is one claim
1257=                about the Senate, one claim about the House.
1258=                                   And the senate claim is only on
1259=                standing because Defendants are not opposing on the
1260=                merits.  And Ms. Hunt has standing under all of the
1261=                applicable redistricting law.
1262=                                   On the House claim, the standard is
1263=                clear.  Defendants bear the burden of justifying the
1264=                enacted map by demonstrating that it crosses as few lines
1265=                as possible, to comply with federal constitutional
1266=                requirements, and they cannot meet their burden.
1267=                                   Plaintiffs' expert, in addition to the
1268=                lack of testimony from Defendants' expert, will
1269=                demonstrate that it is, in fact, possible to divide far
1270=                fewer.
1271=                                   So redistricting is complex, but the
1272=                issues here are not complex and are not a close call.
1273=                                   On the senate, it's not a close call
1274=                that Ms. Hunt has standing.  Article 2, Section 3 of the
1275=                                       (615) 400-3673                    47
fmt=pb
1276=                Constitution requires, with no ambiguity, in a county
1277=                having more than one senatorial district, the districts
1278=                shall be numbered consecutively.  The enacted senate map
1279=                doesn't do that.  It numbers them 17, 19, 20, and 21.  And
1280=                Ms. Hunt lives in 17.
1281=                                   Now, Defendants don't defend the case
1282=                on their merits.  They agree the districts are
1283=                nonconsecutive.  And they haven't put on any either fact
1284=                or expert witnesses to contradict the merits.
1285=                                   Francie Hunt, who you'll hear from
1286=                first, does live in District 17, has voted in District 17,
1287=                will vote in District 17 in the future.
1288=                                   We are instructed by our Supreme Court
1289=                to construe the Constitution's language as precise and
1290=                devoid of surplusage.  As recently as last year, our
1291=                Supreme Court reminded us of that fact in Metro Government
1292=                of Nashville and Davidson County versus the Tennessee
1293=                Department of Education.
1294=                                   It stated that we are to read the
1295=                language as precise enough to reflect the intent of the
1296=                founders of that document.
1297=                                   And, here, the language is precise to
1298=                say exactly what the founders meant.  They meant
1299=                consecutive numbering has to be applied.  Not somewhat
1300=                close to consecutive numbering, consecutive numbering.
1301=                                       (615) 400-3673                    48
fmt=pb
1302=                                   We're also required to not read any
1303=                surplusage into our constitutional language.
1304=                                   And Defendants' arguments here, either
1305=                about past election results -- which we submit are
1306=                irrelevant to this question -- or about the fact that
1307=                three of the districts are odd and one is even, so there
1308=                could never be a full turnover, would do exactly what
1309=                we're counseled not to.  That would render the consecutive
1310=                language surplus.  It would be saying, "Yes, they said
1311=                consecutive.  But since three are even and one is odd and
1312=                there can't be a full turnover, that's what they meant."
1313=                                   But this is clear, unambiguous
1314=                language, and we are required to not go outside of that
1315=                language.  We're required to strictly construe the text of
1316=                the Constitution.  And in this case, it requires
1317=                consecutive numbering.  That has the effect of a fully
1318=                staggered term county senate delegation.  And Ms. Hunt has
1319=                been denied the opportunity to vote for such a -- for such
1320=                a situation, for a staggered term senate delegation, and
1321=                to be represented by it.
1322=                                   There's not a close call that that is
1323=                what the language says.  It's plain and unambiguous.  And
1324=                she's been denied the right.
1325=                                   Now, Defendants point to primarily
1326=                standing cases outside for redistricting to point to -- to
1327=                                       (615) 400-3673                    49
fmt=pb
1328=                try to say this is a generalized grievance.  But
1329=                generalized grievances do not throw out redistricting
1330=                cases because in redirecting cases, so long as you're not
1331=                just anyone from the whole state trying to assert
1332=                something about Nashville, you're not a generalized person
1333=                trying to uphold good government.
1334=                                   This is an exact example.  Every other
1335=                Tennesseean outside of Davidson County is being provided
1336=                the benefit of what they're required to have from the
1337=                Constitution.  If they live in a county with more than two
1338=                senate districts, theirs are consecutively numbered.  A
1339=                much smaller subset of Nashville -- of Tennessee voters in
1340=                Davidson County, and in District 17 specifically, do share
1341=                the injury, but that doesn't make it generalized.  The
1342=                generalized language that they rely on comes from cases
1343=                outside of the redistricting arena.
1344=                                   Instead, in the redistricting arena,
1345=                it's just a common sense fact that the injury is going to
1346=                be shared with a subset of people.  It can't not be when
1347=                you're looking at whether a whole county was split,
1348=                whether a district violates the Voting Rights Act, whether
1349=                a noncontiguous district is at issue, the injury is going
1350=                to be shared.
1351=                                   In our Tennessee Supreme Court, in
1352=                Lockert, has recognized the excellent policy reasons for

1354=                the presence of a provision that counties must be
1355=                represented in the senate, recognizing the importance of
1356=                counties as political subdivisions.
1357=                                   So our Supreme Court has said that is a
1358=                very valid state rational basis, and our founders have
1359=                said that it needs to be consecutively numbered.
1360=                                   We submit that that leads to a fully
1361=                staggered senate delegation and that that's the right
1362=                that's being denied here.
1363=                                   Now, Dr. Cervas will testify.  His
1364=                testimony is un-rebutted.  The defendants did not hire
1365=                experts to respond on his senate testimony.
1366=                                   But he will show that, in addition to
1367=                the clear and obvious violation of just not being
1368=                consecutively numbered, that it could, in fact, have been
1369=                consecutively numbered.
1370=                                   And that's where Defendants raise a new
1371=                argument in their pretrial brief, which is that there's
1372=                something along the lines of no legal framework for
1373=                changing the numbers of districts.
1374=                                   And we'll get into this with
1375=                Dr. Cervas.  But in order to correct the numbering, there
1376=                will need to be switching of some even-for-even districts
1377=                and odd-for-odd districts so that the whole map has
1378=                consecutive numbering.
1379=                                       (615) 400-3673                    51
fmt=pb
1380=                                   It's very few switches.  But Defendants
1381=                say that that prevents redressability under the standing.
1382=                But the numbers are the names of the districts.
1383=                                   I want to back up and think for a
1384=                second about if the people of Knoxville decided it's
1385=                finally time to truly honor Pat Summitt, and we're going
1386=                to work with our legislators to rename Knoxville Summitt
1387=                City, the day that went into effect, the Knoxville city
1388=                council members wouldn't all of a sudden be out of office.
1389=                Their terms wouldn't be ended.  The name of their
1390=                political subdivision would have been changed, and they
1391=                would continue to serve out the rest of their terms.
1392=                                   That's the exact same situation here.
1393=                If the legislature, through a remedial map, which is
1394=                statutory, as part of that remedial map, changes District
1395=                14, which is Senator Shane Reeves, to District 18, so that
1396=                Rutherford's districts will stay consecutive, that's not
1397=                going to all of a sudden kick Senator Reeves out of office
1398=                two years into his four-year term.  It's merely going to
1399=                change the name of his district.
1400=                                   The remedial maps that Dr. Cervas has
1401=                created show that no conflict of incumbents is going to
1402=                come up.  There's not going to be somebody drawn out of
1403=                their district.
1404=                                   And so the only issue they're raising
1405=                                       (615) 400-3673                    52
fmt=pb
1406=                is that you can't change 18 to 14.  Or maybe you can.
1407=                They're really just saying there's an absence of law.
1408=                                   But there's no reason articulated why
1409=                the General Assembly can't change the numbering of
1410=                districts, as long as they follow the clear constitutional
1411=                requirement that those numbers be consecutive.
1412=                                   And so Ms. Hunt prevails in this case.
1413=                And if she doesn't prevail, that's a ruling that no
1414=                citizen can challenge a clear constitutional requirement
1415=                and that the General Assembly is free to number all of the
1416=                large county senate districts however they choose.
1417=                Because if Ms. Hunt doesn't have standing, then no
1418=                citizens have standing.
1419=                                   On the house claim, this is also not a
1420=                close call.  Citing Lockert 1 and Lockert 2, in denying
1421=                the motion for summary judgment, this Court reiterated
1422=                that the burden has shifted to Defendants to show that the
1423=                General Assembly was justified in passing a
1424=                reapportionment map that crossed county lines and to show
1425=                that as few county lines as necessary were crossed to
1426=                comply with the federal constitutional requirements.
1427=                                   It's not a close call.  You're going to
1428=                hear from Dr. Cervas that it is very doable to have 24,
1429=                23, 22 splits.  And so to have stopped at 30 is not a
1430=                close call, that that is not the fewest necessary to
1431=                                       (615) 400-3673                    53
fmt=pb
1432=                comply with federal constitutional requirements.
1433=                                   Now, I want to talk about the order of
1434=                operations, the discussion I had responding to Judge
1435=                Maroney about here on March 7th.
1436=                                   It's important for us to remember the
1437=                order of operations in our law.  Our federal constitution
1438=                is the supreme law of the land, and it and federal laws
1439=                trump conflicting state laws, including the state
1440=                constitution.
1441=                                   On the state level, the constitution is
1442=                a supreme law of the land, and it would trump any
1443=                unconstitutional statutes.
1444=                                   And then, of course, below that, below
1445=                even statutes, states have some ability to have practices
1446=                that they follow.
1447=                                   And so before one-person, one-vote
1448=                became a doctrine applied to our U.S. Supreme Court, the
1449=                Tennessee Constitution said you shall not divide counties
1450=                in redistricting the house, and so you couldn't.  You
1451=                couldn't for incumbency protection.  You couldn't for
1452=                preserving prior cores.  You couldn't for any other reason
1453=                that you wanted to because our constitution said you
1454=                can't.
1455=                                   The only thing that changed is the U.S.
1456=                Supreme Court determined that the equal protection clause
1457=                                       (615) 400-3673                    54
fmt=pb
1458=                requires equal population.  And congress passed the Voting
1459=                Rights Act.
1460=                                   And so our Supreme Court said you still
1461=                can't divide counties unless you're doing so for a
1462=                preempting federal reason, a federal constitutional
1463=                reason, and the Voting Rights Act.
1464=                                   What that boils down to is one-person,
1465=                one-vote or a preservation of minority voting strength.
1466=                                   And so that's the why behind the
1467=                standard.  And I think when you back up, it makes sense.
1468=                You can't divide these for state reasons.  You can only
1469=                divide them for a preempting federal reason.  And that's
1470=                why the Lockerts have articulated it, as the legislature
1471=                having to make a good-faith effort to divide as few
1472=                county -- cross as few county lines as necessary to comply
1473=                with federal constitutional requirements.
1474=                                   And the burden at this point is on the
1475=                defendants to justify the map.  And they cannot do so.
1476=                                   Defendants withheld all factual proof
1477=                about whether or not the mapmaker working with the
1478=                legislators tried to do so or did so.
1479=                                   You'll hear that through Mr. Himes, who
1480=                through privilege objections sustained by this Court, is
1481=                unable to testify whether he tried to create fewer than 30
1482=                county splits, whether he created some maps that do create
1483=                                       (615) 400-3673                    55
fmt=pb
1484=                fewer than 30 splits, whether any members of the
1485=                legislature asked him to, whether any members of the
1486=                legislature asked him to split a county that had been
1487=                together for other reasons.
1488=                                   All of that evidence is off the table
1489=                under privilege.  So there's no factual support to meet
1490=                their burden.
1491=                                   There's also no expert support to meet
1492=                their burden.  In fact, the experts will testify, as they
1493=                did at their depositions, they were not retained to make
1494=                an expert opinion about whether or not the enacted house
1495=                map divides as few counties as necessary to comply with
1496=                the federal constitutional requirements.  And they don't
1497=                have an opinion on that point.  They don't have an opinion
1498=                on that point.
1499=                                   They do have an opinion that Dr. Cervas
1500=                has made certain maps that they don't like.  And they'll
1501=                point out why they think his illustrative maps are
1502=                problematic.  But they don't have an opinion that would
1503=                establish the burden that the enacted house map divides as
1504=                few counties as necessary to comply with the federal
1505=                constitution.
1506=                                   Beyond that, the legislative history
1507=                will reveal that during public hearings, the only factual
1508=                evidence that we have, there was never a mention from
1509=                                       (615) 400-3673                    56
fmt=pb
1510=                Mr. Himes or the representatives enacting the bill of the
1511=                actual standard that they should be trying to meet, to
1512=                divide as few counties as necessary to comply with the
1513=                federal constitution.
1514=                                   And when a member of the House said,
1515=                "Aren't we supposed to be dividing as few?"
1516=                                   Mr. Himes, advising them in his role as
1517=                counsel to the House, stated, that, "After you reach 30,
1518=                it's just a policy decision, whether to reduce fewer."
1519=                                   That's not what our Supreme Court says.
1520=                                   And, finally, Defendants have made the
1521=                choice to have an expert witness here, who is also a fact
1522=                witness.  Mr. Himes drew the maps, and he is the expert to
1523=                defend the maps he drew.
1524=                                   And he, in his expert hat, listed what
1525=                he determined as an expert were the justifications for
1526=                each of the counties split in the enacted house map.  And
1527=                for six of them, he listed core preservation, and for a
1528=                seventh, he listed core preservation and incumbent
1529=                protection.  None of those are federal constitutional
1530=                requirements and cannot justify splits.
1531=                                   So Defendants don't meet their burden,
1532=                and Plaintiffs prevail on that point as a result.
1533=                                   But Plaintiffs will also submit
1534=                Dr. Cervas's testimony to say it's not just an academic
1535=                                       (615) 400-3673                    57
fmt=pb
1536=                failure to meet the burden, it's failure to meet the
1537=                burden, coupled with demonstration that significantly
1538=                fewer counties could have been split.
1539=                                   Now, Dr. Cervas's overall testimony
1540=                that significantly fewer counties could have been split on
1541=                2020 demographics, while still complying with the federal
1542=                constitution, is un-rebutted.  Because Defendants' experts
1543=                don't have an opinion on that point.  They only have
1544=                opinion on his illustrative maps.
1545=                                   But he'll demonstrate, particularly
1546=                through his maps 13C and 13D_e that with the same
1547=                majority-minority districts as the enacted house map, with
1548=                a similar or lower variation in the enacted house map,
1549=                with six fewer county splits than the enacted house map,
1550=                and, ultimately, with the equivalent core preservation,
1551=                and incumbent protection, and with no un-contiguities, he
1552=                will show those maps, demonstrating that on all of those
1553=                factors, there could have been far fewer splits with
1554=                either the same or better metrics on all the other points.
1555=                                   And so he, in addition to the
1556=                defendants' failure of proof, will demonstrate that, in
1557=                fact, far fewer -- over 20 percent fewer counties should
1558=                have been divided.
1559=                                   So Mr. Wygant prevails on his claims.
1560=                Because he has standing as someone whose district was
1561=                                       (615) 400-3673                    58
fmt=pb
1562=                divided, in violation in the constitution, because
1563=                Defendants are unable to meet their burden of
1564=                demonstrating the enacted house map crossed as few county
1565=                lines as necessary to comply with federal constitutional
1566=                requirements, and because Defendants' own witness says
1567=                that the enacted house map divided seven out of 30
1568=                counties for reasons other than federal constitutional
1569=                requirements.
1570=                                   And so redistricting can be complex.
1571=                We agree.  But the claims aren't complex here.  And the
1572=                calls aren't close calls.
1573=                                   Both plaintiffs prevail on their
1574=                claims.  And under the statute that enacted this Court,
1575=                TCA 20-11-105 -- or 18-105.
1576=                                   But, you know, the remedy we seek is
1577=                the Court providing time for the legislature to correct
1578=                the identified constitutional defects.  And if the
1579=                legislature doesn't do so by the Court's deadline, for the
1580=                Court to impose an interim map.
1581=                                   Thank you, Your Honors.
1582=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
1583=                                   MR. RIEGER:  May it please the Court,
1584=                I'll be handling the house section of the opening, and
1585=                Mr. Swatley will handle the senate portion.
1586=                                   To start on the house map, perfection
1587=                                       (615) 400-3673                    59
fmt=pb
1588=                is not the standard.  Perfection cannot be the standard.
1589=                And how do we know this?
1590=                                   First, look at what the Tennessee
1591=                Supreme Court has said.  In Lincoln County versus Crowell,
1592=                they expressly rejected a map that was more perfect than
1593=                the map it was challenging.
1594=                                   In Lincoln County versus Crowell, you
1595=                had a map that split both Lincoln County and Marshall
1596=                County.  The Supreme Court was presented with another
1597=                map -- an alternative map by the plaintiffs that only
1598=                split Lincoln and no longer split Marshall.  The Supreme
1599=                Court said that's not enough.  That would require
1600=                perfection.
1601=                                   So when faced with a map that did
1602=                nothing except reduce a split one more time, the Supreme
1603=                Court said perfection was not required.
1604=                                   We also know by the Supreme Court's
1605=                actions.  Lockert 2.  The Chancery Court in Lockert 2
1606=                found that it was optimal to split 25 counties and that
1607=                that was the number.  That number was perfect.  The
1608=                Supreme Court did not go with 25.  The Supreme Court said
1609=                no more than 30.
1610=                                   So we know that the standard that
1611=                Plaintiffs are articulating, which is perfection, is not
1612=                required.  And we know it because the Tennessee Supreme
1613=                                       (615) 400-3673                    60
fmt=pb
1614=                Court says it's not required, and the Tennessee Supreme
1615=                Court's actions demonstrate that it is not required.
1616=                                   We can also see that if you look at the
1617=                urban -- the Lockert 2 section regarding urban counties.
1618=                No one is going to disclaim the fact that if you can split
1619=                an urban county, you can get fewer splits all together.
1620=                The amount of population deviation that you save by being
1621=                able to split an urban county is significant.  And by
1622=                splitting, for example, a Shelby County, you can get fewer
1623=                splits overall.
1624=                                   Lockert 2 said you can't do that.
1625=                Lockert 2 said if you fall within the deviation window and
1626=                aren't at risk for one-person, one-vote,
1627=                unconstitutionality under equal protection, which is a
1628=                federal requirement, you can't split an urban county, even
1629=                if it gets the deviation down and reduces county splits.
1630=                                   So we know that Plaintiffs' argument is
1631=                based on perfection, and we know that that is not the
1632=                standard.
1633=                                   On the house claim, we've got one
1634=                plaintiff left.  And I don't want to retread a lot of
1635=                ground that we argued in the motion in limine in terms of
1636=                evidence.
1637=                                   But I do want to reiterate, Mr. Wygant
1638=                lives in Gibson County.  That is where his injury occurs.
1639=                                       (615) 400-3673                    61
fmt=pb
1640=                While the Court has denied our motion in limine and has
1641=                agreed to accept testimony and testimony that falls
1642=                outside and is unrelated to Gibson County, if Gibson
1643=                County is -- if that split is constitutional, Mr. Wygant's
1644=                claim is resolved.  That should be it.
1645=                                   Because if the Court did not -- if the
1646=                Court allows someone who is in a district to challenge the
1647=                constitutionality of another county split that they don't
1648=                live in, Plaintiff Turner should still be in this case.
1649=                And this Court correctly relied upon United States versus
1650=                Hayes to find that she could not challenge outside.
1651=                                   Now, the proof in this case will
1652=                demonstrate that the overarching goal of this map was that
1653=                it was designed to comply with one-person, one-vote and
1654=                the federal requirements equal protection.
1655=                                   And we're going to get you there by
1656=                walking you through each split.  Every single split, the
1657=                population map behind it, and where it falls in the
1658=                redistricting process, what pressures due to Voting Rights
1659=                Act, majority-minority districts, due to the unique
1660=                geography of our state, and due to the location of the
1661=                urban centers, how each split is justified by equal
1662=                protection.  And we're going to demonstrate that the
1663=                federal requirement purveyed every single split in this
1664=                map.
1665=                                       (615) 400-3673                    62
fmt=pb
1666=                                   The proof is going to show that
1667=                Tennessee has 95 counties.  We all know this.  But the
1668=                proof of the map of the population will demonstrate that
1669=                only ten can remain whole, either only split internally or
1670=                standing alone and apart.
1671=                                   Which means that we have 85 counties
1672=                that we have to do something with.  Equal protection,
1673=                one-person, one-vote, says that those 85 counties can't
1674=                stand by themselves, we have to do something with them.
1675=                So it is an 85-piece puzzle, for which there are infinite
1676=                combinations.
1677=                                   But the ultimate combination in every
1678=                action done is to help create districts that satisfy
1679=                one-person, one-vote.
1680=                                   And you're going to hear proof that the
1681=                tools the General Assembly uses are the tools that it's
1682=                permitted to under Article 2, Section 4, which starts by
1683=                saying:  Notwithstanding this article and this section,
1684=                the General Assembly can adopt or use whatever
1685=                redistricting criteria it wants to use.
1686=                                   In this case, when determining how to
1687=                solve the 85-piece puzzle and get everything in compliance
1688=                with one-person, one-vote, the proof is going to
1689=                demonstrate that the General Assembly relies upon the
1690=                tools of things like core preservations and the other
1691=                                       (615) 400-3673                    63
fmt=pb
1692=                provisions of the statute, which sets out the house
1693=                redistricting criteria.
1694=                                   And, more importantly, the Supreme
1695=                Court has stated that it has not validated a map in which
1696=                it has not been shown that there was bad faith or ulterior
1697=                motive.
1698=                                   And, in this case, the legislature had
1699=                no better map before it.
1700=                                   Dr. Cervas has spent the last -- almost
1701=                a year, at this point, trying to come up with better maps.
1702=                                   The proof is going to show that we had
1703=                the census data for five months.  Dr. Cervas has had a
1704=                year.
1705=                                   And only until D_e2, which was the
1706=                late-timed map, did he come anywhere close to anything
1707=                that was better, that was just objectively more perfect.
1708=                Again, perfections is not the standard.
1709=                                   But the fact that it took Dr. Cervas so
1710=                long, the fact that Plaintiffs had so many problems with
1711=                Dr. Cervas's maps, the fact that so many of them were
1712=                constitutional, and the fact that the maps before the
1713=                General Assembly at the time that the enacted house map
1714=                was ultimately adopted, were so blatantly
1715=                unconstitutional, rejecting those bad maps cannot import
1716=                bad faith to the General Assembly.
1717=                                       (615) 400-3673                    64
fmt=pb
1718=                                   The proof will show that the map --
1719=                that the map is constitutional.
1720=                                   And, at this point, I will turn it over
1721=                to my colleague, Mr. Swatley, to talk about the senate.
1722=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honors, as you know,
1723=                on the senate claim, it's about nonconsecutive numbering
1724=                of the Davidson County senatorial districts.
1725=                                   Now, we're not defending the merits of
1726=                the claim because the plaintiff, an individual voter, does
1727=                not have standing.  So we don't get to the merits here.
1728=                                   As the Court is well aware, the
1729=                Tennessee standing doctrine generally comports with
1730=                Article 3 standing at the federal level.
1731=                                   And two elements of standing, which we
1732=                believe the plaintiff here cannot meet, is that she
1733=                suffered a distinct and palpable injury or an injury in
1734=                fact.
1735=                                   An injury in law?  Sure.  But not an
1736=                injury in fact.  And an injury in law is not enough.
1737=                There must be some type of concrete harm.  We submit that
1738=                the plaintiffs have not carried their burden, which is
1739=                their burden, to show that there is a concrete harm.
1740=                                   Additionally, we believe there's a
1741=                redressability problem that Plaintiffs cannot overcome.
1742=                                   The maps that their expert produced are
1743=                                       (615) 400-3673                    65
fmt=pb
1744=                fundamentally flawed because they're shown as three
1745=                different maps that could have been enacted instead of the
1746=                enacted plan.  But there's a couple of issues there.
1747=                                   One, we've had an election since then.
1748=                Any of those maps would renumber four senate districts.
1749=                                   Now, the problem is that if you
1750=                renumbered 18 to 14, you're not just swapping a number.
1751=                The senator was voted in for representing District 18 or
1752=                District 14.
1753=                                   If you redrew District 18 to cover a
1754=                completely different area, the senator that was elected to
1755=                District 18 is now no longer eligible to continue serving
1756=                because they've been drawn out.  And the Tennessee
1757=                Constitution requires that senators must not only live in
1758=                the district they represent, but they also must -- they
1759=                also must have lived there for a year.  Now, that would be
1760=                the new district.
1761=                                   But, ultimately, any redressability
1762=                problem here, as the proof will show, will only create
1763=                potentially more legal peril for this map.
1764=                                   The issue here is that the Tennessee
1765=                Constitution is just not equipped to deal with the
1766=                renumbering of senate districts.  And Plaintiffs have no
1767=                proof to show anything different as far as that their maps
1768=                would actually comply with the constitution, even though
1769=                                       (615) 400-3673                    66
fmt=pb
1770=                they may consecutively number.
1771=                                   But, regardless, there is no injury in
1772=                fact.  This plaintiff cannot show it.
1773=                                   Generally, the plaintiff has shown --
1774=                the two different ways they try to show an injury in fact
1775=                through piecing together different redistricting and
1776=                election law buzzwords, one of them is that the
1777=                nonconsecutive numbering somehow violates the right of
1778=                Davidson County voters to consecutively numbered
1779=                senatorial delegation.
1780=                                   And the word that -- senatorial
1781=                delegation is where any claim based on the right to vote
1782=                fails.  Because the right to vote, as has been gone over
1783=                extensively, is an individual right.
1784=                                   We have single-member districts in the
1785=                senate in Tennessee by constitutional mandate.  Every
1786=                Tennesseean is represented by one senator.  They are not
1787=                represented by a delegation.
1788=                                   Now, there's no claims here about the
1789=                district itself.  There's no claim that it's
1790=                mal-apportioned, that it violates one-person, one-vote,
1791=                that it violates the Voting Rights Act, the county splits,
1792=                or anything else.
1793=                                   And as Plaintiffs' counsel said, the
1794=                numbers are just the name of the district.  It's the label
1795=                                       (615) 400-3673                    67
fmt=pb
1796=                we place on it.  It's not the district itself.
1797=                                   So, ultimately, if the person votes in
1798=                that district, there's nothing wrong with that district.
1799=                Their right to vote is not infringed by when other
1800=                districts vote in relation there.
1801=                                   So just from a logical standpoint, any
1802=                claim based on the right to vote fails here because the
1803=                right to vote is just not infringed.
1804=                                   And as the Tennessee Supreme Court has
1805=                told us, in ACOU versus Darnell, there's no standing based
1806=                on the right to vote when the right to vote is not
1807=                infringed.
1808=                                   For the same reasons, there's no
1809=                dilution of a vote.  Again, we're talking about the label
1810=                here.  There's nothing wrong with the district lines
1811=                itself.
1812=                                   The other way the plaintiffs have tried
1813=                to articulate and the way that the Court did point out
1814=                where this issue is headed, is that there is a potential
1815=                benefit being deprived of consecutive numbering of
1816=                Davidson County.
1817=                                   Now, if Davidson County were
1818=                consecutively numbered, they would vote on two senators
1819=                running for reelection during presidential years and two
1820=                during the governor race.  So two and two.
1821=                                       (615) 400-3673                    68
fmt=pb
1822=                                   And, here, obviously, we have 3-1.
1823=                                   So what the claim here is that there's
1824=                somehow a deprivation of a stable senate delegation and
1825=                avoiding turnover in senate representation and preserving
1826=                institutional knowledge.
1827=                                   Well, let's be clear.  The enacted
1828=                senate map perfectly maintains the staggered terms of the
1829=                Tennessee Senate, where 17 senators run, and then 16
1830=                senators run two years later.
1831=                                   So if the institutional knowledge is
1832=                preserved for every Tennesseean, and on the margins, one
1833=                extra Davidson County senator running for reelection every
1834=                four years does not change the institutional knowledge of
1835=                the senate.  Not in any tangible or intangible way that
1836=                would confer some type of harm for standing.  It's just
1837=                not possible.
1838=                                   But, additionally, we dive deeper into
1839=                this issue and we say this benefit that's being allegedly
1840=                deprived has to be identified to see if it is being
1841=                deprived.
1842=                                   And we submit the benefit is avoiding
1843=                simultaneous turnover of more than half of Davidson County
1844=                senate districts in a regularly-scheduled election.
1845=                                   Now, there's no chance under this that
1846=                we could have all four turn over in one election at once
1847=                                       (615) 400-3673                    69
fmt=pb
1848=                because it runs on a 3-1 cycle.
1849=                                   So for this benefit to be deprived, you
1850=                would have to have all three Davidson County senators up
1851=                who were up for reelection in '22, or will be up for
1852=                reelection in '26 or '30, all lose at once.
1853=                                   Well, we know from the elections last
1854=                year, in '22, that this did not happen.  There was only
1855=                one of those seats that turned over, and that was due to a
1856=                retirement.
1857=                                   So the plaintiff here hasn't shown any
1858=                actual harm because the benefit has not been deprived.
1859=                And, again, if the benefit is localized to Davidson
1860=                County, it said only two senators could potentially turn
1861=                over at once.
1862=                                   Now, if there's no actual harm, case
1863=                law tells us that, for standing, if there's no actual
1864=                harm, then at least it must be imminent, or at least
1865=                likely to be imminent.
1866=                                   For a number of reasons, all of them
1867=                political realties, this is probably implausible.  It's
1868=                hypothetical.  It's speculative.  And it's certainly not
1869=                imminent.
1870=                                   Incumbency is a very powerful ally in
1871=                politics.  So is, in this situation, the heavy partisan
1872=                lean of Davidson County.
1873=                                       (615) 400-3673                    70
fmt=pb
1874=                                   It's uncontested that -- you know, what
1875=                the election results that will be in the record will show
1876=                you is that Davidson County votes about 2-1 democratic.
1877=                And the senate districts here represent that make-up.  You
1878=                have two heavily democratic senate districts and one heavy
1879=                republican because it takes a sliver in Davidson County,
1880=                and then it has all of Wilson County, where most of the
1881=                population is.
1882=                                   But there's one other point that I
1883=                believe the Court will find enlightening on this subject.
1884=                The nonconsecutive numbering of senate districts in
1885=                Davidson County is not a new concept.  The Court can
1886=                judicial notice of what's already been admitted of the
1887=                1990 senate map, the enacted plan, and the 2000s enacted
1888=                plan.
1889=                                   The senate districts in Davidson County
1890=                for 20 years were not consecutively numbered.  They were
1891=                also on the 3-1 cycle.  We never had a lawsuit about that.
1892=                It never got struck down.
1893=                                   But what that does show us is that this
1894=                majority turnover of the three senators running at once,
1895=                all turning over at once, never happened.  It wasn't even
1896=                close.
1897=                                   Only one time in the last 30 years has
1898=                more than one Davidson County senate seat turned over at
1899=                                       (615) 400-3673                    71
fmt=pb
1900=                one time.  And, ironically, that was because of
1901=                redistricting.  It was when two turned over.  But three
1902=                never has.
1903=                                   So whether it's incumbency being a
1904=                powerful ally, the partisan lean of Davidson County in
1905=                these districts, or the historical data, the plaintiff
1906=                cannot show that three senators running for Davidson
1907=                County, in 2026 or 2030, all losing at once in one
1908=                election is likely, is imminent, is even really possible.
1909=                                   What we are going to see here is that
1910=                it's speculative.  It's conjectural.  It's hypothetical.
1911=                And those are the exact type of claims that the standing
1912=                doctrine has been designed to remove as justiciable
1913=                controversy.
1914=                                   Ms. Hunt cannot show an injury in fact.
1915=                And the plaintiffs have real problems meeting their burden
1916=                for redressability here.  This is fatal because they can't
1917=                show standing.  And the senate claim should be dismissed.
1918=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
1919=                                   We'll have the first witness called.

1932=                BY MR. SPRAGENS:
1933=                Q.           Good morning.  Would you please introduce
1934=                yourself to the Court, and give the Court a little bit of
1935=                background about yourself.
1936=                A.           Hello.  Good morning.  I'm Francie Hunt.  I
1937=                live in Hermitage, Tennessee, which is part of Davidson
1938=                County, Nashville.  It's just on the cusp of Wilson
1939=                County, actually.  And there's Nashville Shores around
1940=                that area and near Andrew Jackson's home, Hermitage.
1941=                             I'm a mother, first and foremost.  I have a
1942=                son, Isaac, who turns 17 tomorrow, and a 22-year-old
1943=                daughter, Eliza.  She is in her final year at Warren
1944=                Wilson College in -- just outside of Asheville, North
1945=                Carolina.
1946=                Q.           And, Ms. Hunt, obviously, we're in a
1947=                makeshift courtroom.  So I'm going to have to ask you to
1948=                keep your voice up as much as possible, just so everybody
1949=                can hear you.
1950=                             So could you please give your address in
1951=                                       (615) 400-3673                    73

1952=                Hermitage.
1953=                A.           Sure.  It's 532 New Castle Lane.
1954=                Q.           And I think you testified earlier, but I
1955=                couldn't quite hear you.
1956=                             That Hermitage address that you gave, that's
1957=                part of Nashville and Davidson County?
1958=                A.           Yes.  It's in Nashville.  I could probably
1959=                also put Nashville as my address.
1960=                Q.           How long have you lived on New Castle Lane?
1961=                A.           I moved there in 2017.
1962=                Q.           And before you moved to New Castle Lane, were
1963=                you a resident of Nashville or another part of Tennessee?
1964=                A.           I've lived in Nashville the whole time I've
1965=                lived in Tennessee.  I first moved to Donelson, which is
1966=                also in Nashville.  And then raised my children mostly in
1967=                East Nashville.  I owned a bicycle shop there for quite a
1968=                while.  I lived at 1711 Eastland Avenue.
1969=                Q.           And when did you first move to Middle
1970=                Tennessee?
1971=                A.           Back in 1999.
1972=                Q.           You mentioned you owned a bicycle shop.  Can
1973=                you tell the Court a little bit about what you do for a
1974=                living?
1975=                A.           Sure.  I'm the executive director for
1976=                Tennessee Advocates for Planned Parenthood.  I'm also the
1977=                                       (615) 400-3673                    74
fmt=pb
1978=                organizing advocacy director for Planned Parenthood of
1979=                Tennessee and North Mississippi.  And that's what I do
1980=                currently.
1981=                Q.           About how long have you worked with Planned
1982=                Parenthood?
1983=                A.           Ten years.  This is my Planiversary.
1984=                Q.           And before that, what type of work did you
1985=                do?
1986=                A.           Most of my career, I have been a child
1987=                advocate.  So I moved to Tennessee, actually, to get Stand
1988=                for Children started, which is a child advocacy
1989=                organization.
1990=                             We worked closely with the governor to expand
1991=                prekindergarten here in the state to help 16,000 at-risk
1992=                young people, four-year-olds, in the state.  I'm really
1993=                proud of that.  Worked on a lot of, you know, school
1994=                support issues.
1995=                             I also helped get communities in Schools
1996=                Started, which is another nonprofit.  We helped bring in
1997=                social workers into schools that --
1998=                             The concept was, you know, in order for our
1999=                young people to be successful academically, we also need
2000=                to be addressing their wraparound services, making sure
2001=                that they're healthy and eating and that sort of thing.
2002=                So communities and schools was another area of work that

fmt=pb
2004=                I've done.
2005=                             On my own time, I've also been on the board
2006=                for Walk Bike Nashville, which is a transit advocacy
2007=                organization.  I was on the board for the Nashville Public
2008=                Library for many years as well.
2009=                Q.           It's fair to say that you're pretty involved
2010=                in the community?
2011=                A.           Yes.
2012=                Q.           Ms. Hunt, are you registered to vote in

2014=                A.           Yes.
2015=                Q.           And how long have you been registered to vote
2016=                here?
2017=                A.           As soon as I moved here.
2018=                Q.           Late 1990s?
2019=                A.           Yeah.  1999.
2020=                Q.           What party is your registration affiliated
2021=                with?
2022=                A.           Democrat.
2023=                Q.           And do you vote regularly in elections?
2024=                A.           Yes.
2025=                Q.           Does that include primary and general
2026=                elections?
2027=                A.           All of the elections.  Yes.
2028=                Q.           Does that include local, state, and federal

2030=                elections?
2031=                A.           Yes.  Local, state, and federal.
2032=                Q.           Do you plan to vote in upcoming elections in
2033=                Davidson County?
2034=                A.           Yes.
2035=                Q.           Do you know which Senate House -- excuse
2036=                me -- State Senate District you live in?
2037=                A.           I do.  I live in Senate District 17.
2038=                Q.           And who is your current state senator in
2039=                District 17?
2040=                A.           Senator Mark Pody.
2041=                Q.           Now, Ms. Hunt, you understand you're here
2042=                today as part of a lawsuit that you brought.
2043=                             What is your understanding of the allegations
2044=                in this lawsuit as they relate to the State Senate
2045=                District?
2046=                A.           Well, I'm in Senate District 17.  There isn't
2047=                a Senate District 18 in Davidson County.  And then it goes
2048=                19, 20, and 21.
2049=                             And according to the Constitution, plainly
2050=                stated, it needs to be consecutively numbered.  And that
2051=                is not the case.
2052=                Q.           Are you aware of any other county in
2053=                Tennessee, in which the senate districts are not
2054=                consecutively numbered?
2055=                                       (615) 400-3673                    77
fmt=pb
2056=                A.           I think that Davidson County is the only one
2057=                that is not in congruence with the Constitution.
2058=                Q.           And I believe you testified you live in 17;
2059=                is that right?
2060=                A.           Yes.
2061=                Q.           So would you say that you live in a district
2062=                that is not consecutively numbered with the other three?
2063=                A.           That's right.
2064=                Q.           In a given year, if the districts were
2065=                consecutively numbered, how many state senators in
2066=                Davidson County would be up for election?
2067=                A.           Well, I think that's the problem there, is
2068=                that three would be up.  Because we have four total.  And
2069=                because they're not consecutively numbered, my
2070=                understanding -- and I'm no lawyer -- is that the
2071=                advantage of having staggered numbers that -- or
2072=                consecutive numbers is that it ensures proper staggering
2073=                of elections.
2074=                             And so as it currently stands, it means that,
2075=                in one year, three of our districts would be up during a
2076=                gubernatorial election, and then only one of them would be
2077=                up during a presidential.
2078=                             And that's really the core of the problem
2079=                there.
2080=                Q.           You talked a lot about your, sort of,
2081=                                       (615) 400-3673                    78
fmt=pb
2082=                political advocacy work.
2083=                             What's the significance of being up for
2084=                election in a gubernatorial election year versus a
2085=                presidential election year?
2086=                A.           Yeah.  It's a huge issue.  You know, just
2087=                understanding it from an advocate standpoint, it's pretty,
2088=                unfortunately, common knowledge that under a gubernatorial
2089=                election, there is -- there are fewer people.  I mean, a
2090=                presidential election will drive turnout.
2091=                             So that creates a big problem, in terms of
2092=                making sure that there's some fair and equitable
2093=                representation in my county, in particular for my district
2094=                and for me.
2095=                Q.           You heard -- you've been in the courtroom
2096=                this morning; is that correct?
2097=                             You've been in this courtroom this morning?
2098=                A.           Yes.
2099=                Q.           So you heard the State's opening argument.
2100=                You heard about whether you have a distinct and palpable
2101=                injury, concrete harm, or that there's been any benefit
2102=                deprived to you as a voter by this nonconsecutive
2103=                numbering.
2104=                             Can you tell the Court a little bit about the
2105=                impact on you as a voter and a resident of Davidson County
2106=                to have the delegation when -- this 3-1 pattern, instead
2107=                                       (615) 400-3673                    79
fmt=pb
2108=                of the 2-2 pattern?
2109=                A.           Sure.
2110=                             I mean, I'm actually deeply offended to hear
2111=                that I don't get to use my voice to even raise this as an
2112=                issue as a voter in my district.  Because, to me, if I as
2113=                a voter can't have a say in how my voice is represented,
2114=                then, kind of, what's the point?
2115=                             But I think to speak to the injury directly,
2116=                you know, to contextualize it, in this moment, I think
2117=                it's really clear that even as we've seen with the -- all
2118=                the talks around the Tennessee Three happening right now,
2119=                there's a deep suspicion around the legitimacy of
2120=                democracy right now.
2121=                             And I have felt this now, as someone who
2122=                really cares about an individual's right to bodily
2123=                autonomy and to my right to make my own private decisions
2124=                over my own healthcare.  As a mother.  As someone who's
2125=                had a miscarriage.  You know, I think that those decisions
2126=                around a person's healthcare and their pregnancy need to
2127=                absolutely be left up to that individual person and not
2128=                left up to Government.
2129=                             And, you know, when Roe fell last year, I
2130=                mean, I felt that.  That was not a cerebral injury.  That
2131=                was, like, a very deep injury that I personally felt.
2132=                             And I think that, for me, if we can't rely on
2133=                                       (615) 400-3673                    80
fmt=pb
2134=                protecting the Constitution that is plainly written, then
2135=                what is the meaning of it?  I mean, that's kind of where I
2136=                feel like, you know --
2137=                             I think that what our -- what governor --
2138=                what the governor and the State of Tennessee has done in
2139=                terms of our rights and our voice, I don't agree with
2140=                that.  But if I knew that the rules that we were following
2141=                by and that the word of the Constitution was being
2142=                followed to the letter, I at least could live with that.
2143=                And that's, to me, what -- what's at stake.  That's, to
2144=                me, what I so personally bring to this.
2145=                             And it's not -- it's me, for sure.  But it's
2146=                also my neighborhood, my city of Nashville, and everybody
2147=                who shares the same values that I do.
2148=                Q.           You talked about "our rights and our voice
2149=                and the city of Nashville."
2150=                             From your perspective, with the
2151=                non-consecutively numbered senate districts, what is the

2153=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, objection,
2154=                for relevance.  Nashville isn't a party here.  There's

2160=                Q.           Ms. Hunt, as a citizen of Nashville, what is
2161=                your personal view on legislative developments that affect
2162=                you and your city under the 3-1 staggered system that we
2163=                have in place today?

2165=                             I mean, it's clear that we are all operating
2166=                under a super majority, a Republican super majority at the
2167=                state level.  And they don't share my view a lot of times,
2168=                and they don't share, I think, you know, Nashville's view
2169=                a lot of times.
2170=                             And so it feels like -- especially when we
2171=                have, in this current iteration of the redistricting, a
2172=                situation where there is unfair representation, where it's
2173=                a 3-1 split, where three of those districts are going to
2174=                be voting during an election cycle that has a lower
2175=                turnout rate, by comparison to the presidential, it does
2176=                continue to put us at a disadvantage.
2177=                             And so I feel like I'm voting with both hands
2178=                tied behind my back.  And I'm just pleading, that at least
2179=                make it so that I'm only voting with one arm behind my
2180=                back.  I mean, it's so incredibly painful to be in this
2181=                situation.
2182=                Q.           You know, Ms. Hunt, a few minutes ago you
2183=                heard, in the State's opening statement, about the
2184=                likelihood of turnover of three seats at once.
2185=                                       (615) 400-3673                    82
fmt=pb
2186=                             Is it possible, in your experience as a
2187=                political organizer, for incumbents to lose primary
2188=                elections?
2189=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, objection for
2190=                speculation.  She's not here as an expert.
2191=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  I'm just asking about
2192=                her personal experience, Your Honor.
2193=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  If you would, rephrase,
2194=                please, so maybe it won't sound the way it just sounded.
2195=                Okay?  Please.
2196=                BY MR. SPRAGENS:
2197=                Q.           Ms. Hunt, you have been a political
2198=                organizer, and you're a citizen; is that correct?
2199=                A.           Yes.
2200=                Q.           Have you ever seen an incumbent lose a
2201=                primary election?
2202=                A.           I have not.
2203=                Q.           Have you seen incumbents lose to other
2204=                parties?
2205=                A.           I have not.  It's very difficult to be an
2206=                incumbent.
2207=                Q.           Are you familiar with the staggering of U.S.
2208=                senate terms?  Tennessee has two U.S. senators, and the
2209=                staggering of terms with respect to the U.S. Senate?
2210=                A.           Yes.

2212=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Objection.  She's not
2213=                here for the U.S. Senate.
2214=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  I'll allow it as
2215=                background.
2216=                BY MR. SPRAGENS:
2217=                Q.           And you testified that you are familiar with
2218=                that?
2219=                A.           Yes.
2220=                Q.           How does that concept, in your mind, relate
2221=                to the Tennessee Constitution's requirement that the
2222=                districts be numbered consecutively?
2223=                A.           I think that --
2224=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  If you have an objection,
2225=                go ahead and state it.
2226=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Objection again.  Same
2227=                objection.  It's just -- U.S. senators aren't in the
2228=                Tennessee Constitution or the U.S. Constitution.  It's
2229=                just relevance.
2230=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.  The Court will
2231=                allow it on the limited purpose of trying to bring some
2232=                context to her prior testimony.  But we're not going to
2233=                try a senate case that does not exist.  So --
2234=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  Thank you, Your Honor.
2235=                I'm just trying to get her to articulate the standing
2236=                burden that they've been contesting here.

2238=                BY MR. SPRAGENS:
2239=                Q.           The Court said you can answer that question.
2240=                             How does that comparison work, in your mind?
2241=                A.           I mean, I think that the comparison, to me,
2242=                illustrates that it's fairly common for staggering to
2243=                occur so that you not only have fair and equitable
2244=                representation, but, also, there's at least a structural
2245=                aspect to ensuring that there is expertise in leadership
2246=                in that incumbency that can be there over time.
2247=                Q.           And is that what you were testifying to
2248=                earlier, about Nashville and its voice in the state
2249=                legislature?
2250=                A.           Yes.
2251=                Q.           As a plaintiff in this lawsuit, what are you
2252=                asking this Court to do to remedy the
2253=                non-consecutively-numbered districts?
2254=                A.           My request is very simple, which is to
2255=                recognize, acknowledge, and uphold the Constitution as it
2256=                is written, which is to recognize that the district
2257=                numbers need to be consecutively numbered.
2258=                             And as I heard earlier, you know, that if --
2259=                as someone stated earlier, that it's simply just a matter
2260=                of numbering, as if labels didn't matter, then if that
2261=                were the case, then I just ask that they change the
2262=                labels.

fmt=pb
2264=                Q.           And if the Davidson County senate districts
2265=                are not corrected to comply with the Constitution, do you
2266=                expect, as a voter and a citizen, that that will have an
2267=                impact on your life in the future?
2268=                A.           Absolutely.  We're going to continue to see a
2269=                concentration of powers that will not be in my
2270=                self-interest or my view, and not be able to use my voice
2271=                and vote.
2272=                Q.           And when you say a concentration of powers,
2273=                are you talking about the State with respect to the City
2274=                of Nashville?
2275=                A.           Yes.  Yes.
2276=                             I mean, I think we've seen that with the --
2277=                what I will say, an -- what it feels like, again,
2278=                personally, an overreach from the State into Nashville to
2279=                even decide how we can govern ourselves, where there was
2280=                an effort to, basically, take away my representative at
2281=                the local level, my counsel member, and have the districts
2282=                from 40 to 20.
2283=                Q.           And is it your belief that if the delegation
2284=                were evenly split, you would -- Nashville -- you, as a
2285=                citizen of Nashville, would be more effectively able to
2286=                resist that?
2287=                A.           Yes.  Absolutely.
2288=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  Thank you.  I don't have

2296=                Swatley.  I represent the defendants in this matter.  I
2297=                believe we remember each other from your deposition in

2299=                A.           Mm-hmm.
2300=                Q.           So, if you could, please, I'd ask that you --
2301=                in the books there, if you could turn to Exhibit 84.
2302=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, if I could --
2303=                and, Scott.  I don't think we ever got around to doing the
2304=                checklist sheet as to what's already in.
2305=                                   MR. TIFT:  That's right.  I think we
2306=                could also just proceed, and, like, whenever we get to
2307=                one, just acknowledge, you know, when it's used in court
2308=                that it's admitted.
2309=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Okay.
2310=                                   MR. TIFT:  Since we're already sort of
2311=                in the process.  We could just, for instance, with this
2312=                one, say, you know, "The parties have already agreed this
2313=                will be admitted, so, you know, it's admitted now."
2314=                                   MR. RIEGER:  That's fine.  I just

2317=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  The laundry list can come
2318=                later, on a break.
2319=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  And, Your Honor, this is

2323=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibit 84, just for

2328=                there in the middle of this map, of the Tennessee State
2329=                Senate Districts?
2330=                A.           Yes.
2331=                Q.           Okay.  And I know it's kind of small.  But do
2332=                you recognize the grey bit next to Wilson County that's in

2369=                A.           And let me just clarify because I don't want
2370=                people to think --
2371=                             I actually, generally, orient myself towards
2372=                liking everybody.  And the only reason why I would -- I
2373=                wouldn't want any harm done to Mark Pody.  I just wouldn't
2374=                vote for him.  That's what I mean by "appalled."
2375=                             And the reason for the appall -- being
2376=                appalled is because he was somebody that wanted to make it
2377=                so that the -- the -- the husband would have more power
2378=                over bodily autonomy, than the wife.  And I just don't
2379=                think that's right.
2380=                Q.           So it's fair to say that you don't agree with
2381=                him politically?
2382=                A.           Yes.
2383=                Q.           Now, based on your knowledge, you're not
2384=                bringing a claim here against the senate map for anything,
2385=                other than the numbering?
2386=                A.           Yes.
2387=                Q.           You voted in the Senate District 17 August
2388=                primary last year?
2389=                A.           Yes.
2390=                Q.           You also voted in the November general
2391=                election for Senate District 17?
2392=                A.           Yes.

fmt=pb
2394=                Q.           And, to your knowledge, your vote counted in
2395=                both?
2396=                A.           Yes.
2397=                Q.           And the people voting in your district had
2398=                the opportunity to elect the candidate of their choice
2399=                that was on the ballot last year?
2400=                A.           The candidate of their choice?
2401=                Q.           That was on the ballot.
2402=                A.           I didn't -- there was not a candidate of my
2403=                choice on the ballot that year.
2404=                Q.           Based on your knowledge, the people voting in
2405=                your district, though, had the opportunity to elect the
2406=                candidate of their choice that was on the ballot last
2407=                year; correct?
2408=                A.           They had the opportunity to vote for a
2409=                candidate that was on the ballot.  He was unopposed.
2410=                Q.           Okay.  And you had the opportunity to express
2411=                your individual voice through voting last year in Senate
2412=                District 17?
2413=                A.           Yes.
2414=                Q.           And is it fair to say, based on your
2415=                knowledge, that Nashville and Davidson County lean
2416=                democratic?
2417=                A.           Yes.
2418=                Q.           And based on your personal knowledge, the
2419=                                       (615) 400-3673                    91
fmt=pb
2420=                Davidson County vote, again in your knowledge, generally
2421=                goes for democrats in statewide elections, like governor
2422=                and U.S. senator?
2423=                A.           I think that's true.
2424=                Q.           You believe the senate maps are
2425=                gerrymandered?
2426=                A.           I do.
2427=                Q.           By pairing your sliver of Davidson County
2428=                with all of Wilson County, is your district gerrymandered?
2429=                A.           Yes.  Because it's not consecutively
2430=                numbered, as the Constitution states it needs to be.
2431=                Q.           All right.  Were you frustrated with
2432=                redistricting, where Nashville was divided into several
2433=                different piecemeal districts?
2434=                A.           Yes.  That added insult to injury.
2435=                Q.           And you're not bringing a claim for racial
2436=                gerrymandering here?
2437=                A.           No.
2438=                Q.           Do you imagine it would be in the interest of
2439=                a party in power to redistrict, in a way as to strengthen
2440=                and concentrate their power?
2441=                A.           Yes.
2442=                Q.           Do you believe the party in power would
2443=                redistrict in a way that it would be to their advantage?
2444=                A.           Yes.
2445=                                       (615) 400-3673                    92
fmt=pb
2446=                Q.           And you think the senate was pretty
2447=                successful in that this time?
2448=                A.           Yes.
2449=                Q.           Were they successful in drawing it to where
2450=                their incumbents are not as likely to lose?
2451=                A.           Right.
2452=                Q.           You agree that you're not bringing a claim
2453=                here for political gerrymandering?
2454=                A.           That's correct.
2455=                Q.           Okay.  And consecutive numbering of
2456=                districts, to your knowledge, is designed to ensure
2457=                institutional knowledge in the senate?
2458=                A.           I understand that to be the case.  I think
2459=                it's also just to create just general fairness and equity
2460=                in terms of turnout as well.
2461=                Q.           And you agree that, statewide, the senate
2462=                districts are staggered and that 16 senators are up for
2463=                election, and then 17 are up two years later?
2464=                A.           I don't know that.  You're telling me that.
2465=                I don't have a reason to not believe you.
2466=                Q.           Okay.  Is it fair to say that the benefit of
2467=                consecutive numbering within Davidson County, if there is
2468=                any, is that at any one election, only two Davidson County
2469=                senate seats can turn over?
2470=                A.           Right.
2471=                                       (615) 400-3673                    93
fmt=pb
2472=                Q.           And so, logically, you being deprived of that
2473=                benefit would require -- again, to your knowledge, would
2474=                require three Davidson County senators turning over at one
2475=                time?
2476=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  Object to the legal
2477=                conclusion.
2478=                                   THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry.  I don't
2479=                understand the question.
2480=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Wait a minute.  Let's get
2481=                the objection on the record.
2482=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  Object to the question;
2483=                calls for a legal conclusion.
2484=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Your response?
2485=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Well, Your Honor, she
2486=                says she's deprived of a benefit.  I'm just asking facts
2487=                about the benefit she's being deprived of.  It's the facts
2488=                within her knowledge.
2489=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Objection overruled.
2490=                BY MR. SWATLEY:
2491=                Q.           I'll repeat it.
2492=                             To your knowledge, the benefit you're being
2493=                deprived of would require three Davidson County senators
2494=                turning over at one time?
2495=                A.           So you're asking me, does a 3-1 split hurt
2496=                me?  Yes.  I think that -- there are a lot of words in
2497=                                       (615) 400-3673                    94
fmt=pb
2498=                your question.
2499=                Q.           I'm sorry.  I'll try shorter ones.
2500=                A.           Yeah.
2501=                Q.           If Davidson County senate districts, the four
2502=                senate districts, were consecutively numbered, only two
2503=                would be up at one time?
2504=                A.           That's right.
2505=                Q.           Okay.  And under the current map, last year
2506=                in 2022, and then in '26 and '30, three senators are up at
2507=                one time?
2508=                A.           That's right.
2509=                Q.           So for you not to get the benefit, based on
2510=                your knowledge, all three of those senators would have to
2511=                lose at once in the elections in '26 and '30?
2512=                A.           I don't -- I guess I'm not -- I don't think
2513=                that's the only way that I'm harmed, or that only having
2514=                three --
2515=                             Like, I don't think the harm begins when
2516=                three people lose an election in one year.
2517=                Q.           Okay.  So, in your experience, in almost
2518=                25 years -- or almost 25 years of voting for state
2519=                senators in Tennessee, that these seats don't turn over
2520=                very often?
2521=                A.           That's correct.
2522=                Q.           And when you first moved here in the late
2523=                                       (615) 400-3673                    95
fmt=pb
2524=                1990s, the senate districts were not consecutively
2525=                numbered?
2526=                A.           The senate districts were consecutively
2527=                numbered.
2528=                Q.           In the 1990s?
2529=                A.           Oh, I don't know.  I didn't move here until
2530=                1999.
2531=                Q.           So, in 1999, were they consecutively
2532=                numbered?
2533=                A.           I don't remember.
2534=                Q.           Okay.  If you could flip to Tab 106 for me.
2535=                I believe it will be in a different binder than the one
2536=                you were looking at previously.
2537=                A.           It's the same one, I think.
2538=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Exhibit 31 is a map of
2539=                the 1990s enacted senate plan.  I believe it's been
2540=                admitted, and the Court can take judicial notice that that
2541=                is the 1990 senate plan.  It's also depicted on
2542=                Demonstrative 106.
2543=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Admitted for the record.
2544=                                   (Marked Exhibit 31.)
2545=                BY MR. SWATLEY:

2548=                             Could you please tell me what the numbers of
2549=                                       (615) 400-3673                    96
fmt=pb
2550=                the Davidson County senate districts are.
2551=                A.           It looks like it's 19, 20, 21.
2552=                Q.           And is there one more?
2553=                A.           It looks like there's 17.
2554=                Q.           All right.  And based on your knowledge, 17,
2555=                19, 20, and 21 are the same numbers of the senate
2556=                districts currently?
2557=                A.           I believe that's true.
2558=                Q.           And you filed no lawsuit in 1999 or 2000
2559=                about the senate districts?
2560=                A.           No.  I was busy building my family at that
2561=                time.  So I wasn't looking at maps.
2562=                Q.           So you didn't look at maps, so you didn't
2563=                know they were not consecutively numbered at that time?
2564=                A.           Yeah.  I guess I didn't.
2565=                Q.           So it's painful now, to be in this situation,
2566=                but in the '90s, you didn't know about it?
2567=                A.           In the '90s, no, I didn't know about this.
2568=                Q.           Okay.  Could you please flip to Tab 108.  But
2569=                this also is the -- oh, I'm sorry.
2570=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  So it's Exhibit 32, Your
2571=                Honor.  I believe it's been agreed upon to be admitted.
2572=                It's also Tab 108.
2573=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibit 32 is admitted.
2574=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Thank you, Your Honor.

2576=                                   (Marked Exhibit 32.)
2577=                BY MR. SWATLEY:
2578=                Q.           Ms. Hunt, can you please tell me the numbers
2579=                of the four senate districts on the 2000 senate map that
2580=                you're looking at?
2581=                A.           21, 19, and 20.
2582=                Q.           And then is -- also, is there one more
2583=                number, maybe from Williamson County, coming up into
2584=                Davidson County on there?
2585=                A.           Yes.
2586=                Q.           What is that number?
2587=                A.           23.
2588=                Q.           So the numbers were 19, 20, 21, and 23?
2589=                A.           Yes.
2590=                Q.           Okay.  And you lived in Davidson County
2591=                during the 2000s?
2592=                A.           Yes.
2593=                Q.           Okay.  Were you aware at the time that the --
2594=                you were not aware that they were not consecutively
2595=                numbered?
2596=                A.           No.
2597=                Q.           Was it painful to be in that situation
2598=                then --
2599=                A.           It was --
2600=                Q.           -- but you didn't know?
2601=                                       (615) 400-3673                    98
fmt=pb
2602=                A.           -- apparently.
2603=                Q.           But you didn't know?
2604=                A.           Right.
2605=                Q.           And it was also unfair at that time, but you
2606=                didn't know about it?
2607=                A.           Right.
2608=                             Now that I know about that, it seems that we
2609=                were not in line with what the Constitution had written.
2610=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  May I refer with Counsel
2611=                real quick?
2612=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Of course, you may.
2613=                BY MR. SWATLEY:
2614=                Q.           So in the late 1990s and all through 2000,
2615=                while those two maps were in place, you had a palpable
2616=                harm, but didn't know about it?
2617=                A.           Yeah.  I didn't know about it.
2618=                Q.           From the late 1990s through the 2000s, if you
2619=                didn't know about it, how could it have affected you?
2620=                A.           Well, I think that if -- if -- if, then, as
2621=                it does now, the Constitution states that it needs to be
2622=                consecutive, then it should have been in alignment back in
2623=                the day.
2624=                             And I will say that myself and so many other
2625=                people are becoming more aware of how important it is that
2626=                we ensure that our Constitution is fully followed.
2627=                                       (615) 400-3673                    99
fmt=pb
2628=                Q.           All right.
2629=                A.           So it's not too late.
2630=                Q.           The district number doesn't cause high or low
2631=                turnout, does it?
2632=                A.           Oh, it can.
2633=                Q.           The district number itself?
2634=                A.           Actually, the timing of when it's up for
2635=                election.  Like, whether it's a gubernatorial year or
2636=                presidential.
2637=                Q.           So not the -- it's not the number, it's more
2638=                of when that election falls?
2639=                A.           And I think that odds and evens are assigned
2640=                to a gubernatorial or presidential.
2641=                Q.           And whether a voter votes in an election is
2642=                the choice of the voter; correct?
2643=                A.           Yes.  It's the choice of the voter, and
2644=                there's a lot of other aspects that go into it.  There
2645=                are, you know, voting rights, and accessibility, and
2646=                suppression issues too.
2647=                Q.           But you're not alleging that this map
2648=                violates any of your federal voting rights here?
2649=                A.           I'm saying that it violates the state
2650=                constitution because it's not in numerical order.
2651=                Q.           So when you lived on Ironwood in the late
2652=                '90s, do you recall whether your senator was Senator
fmt=pb
2653=                Harper, Senator Haynes, Senator Henry, or Senator
2654=                Rochelle?
2655=                A.           Say the names again.
2656=                Q.           Senator Harper, who represented District 19.
2657=                Senator Haynes, who represented District 20.  Senator
2658=                Henry, who represented District 21.  Or Senator Rochelle,
2659=                who represented District 17.
2660=                A.           I knew many of them, but I don't remember
2661=                which one.
2662=                Q.           Okay.  Well, when you lived on Eastland
2663=                Avenue in the 2000s, when the senate districts were also
2664=                not consecutively numbered, were you represented by
2665=                Senator Harper, Senator Haynes, Senator Henry, or Senator
2666=                Blackburn, or Bryson, or Johnson?
2667=                A.           It might have been Thelma Harper at that
2668=                point.
2669=                Q.           Okay.
2670=                A.           It definitely wasn't Haynes -- or I'm
2671=                sorry -- Henry.
2672=                Q.           Definitely wasn't Henry?
2673=                A.           Yeah.
2674=                Q.           You think it was Harper?
2675=                A.           Yeah.
2676=                Q.           Okay.  So you -- so your testimony is that in
2677=                the 2000s you lived in Senate District 19, where Senator
fmt=pb
2678=                Harper represented you?
2679=                A.           I think that's a possibility.  I would have
2680=                to look and see.  It's been a long time ago.
2681=                Q.           I understand.
2682=                             Well, if you want, we can look back at
2683=                Tab 108, if you could tell me -- you may be looking at it
2684=                right now.  It may be right in front of you.
2685=                A.           Oh, okay.
2686=                Q.           Can you tell, on that map, where you lived,
2687=                on Eastland Avenue?
2688=                A.           Oh, gosh.  These maps.  This is how it was
2689=                during the redistricting too.  The maps were released
2690=                without any street names.  So it was really hard to tell
2691=                anything.  And that's what it looks like here too.
2692=                             So I'm not sure I could, actually.
2693=                Q.           Okay.  During that redistricting process, did
2694=                you ever download publicly-available shapefiles about the
2695=                senate plans?
2696=                A.           I have.
2697=                Q.           You did download the shapefiles?
2698=                A.           Not the whole thing because it was really
2699=                big.  But I did try to look because I was just -- I really
2700=                was trying to figure out what was happening with
2701=                redistricting.
2702=                Q.           Okay.  But not the shapefiles?
fmt=pb
2703=                A.           There was a -- I don't know the names of
2704=                things.  I don't know if it was called a shapefile.  But
2705=                there was something on the website, where you could click,
2706=                and then it would take you to some map.
2707=                             Is that what you mean by a shapefile?
2708=                Q.           I'm not the one testifying here.
2709=                A.           Okay.  Well, I'm trying --
2710=                             So if that is what is a shapefile, then, yes,
2711=                that is what I opened.  But I didn't download it because I
2712=                wouldn't want to use up that space on my computer.
2713=                Q.           Okay.  And in the 2010s, you were represented
2714=                by Senator Haile in District 18?
2715=                A.           Senator Haile.  What's his first name?
2716=                Q.           Ferrell Haile.
2717=                A.           Oh, Ferrell Haile.  Yes.
2718=                Q.           Yes.
2719=                             And, to your knowledge, you were represented
2720=                by Senator Haile for all of the 2010s, when you lived in
2721=                District 18?
2722=                A.           I don't remember.  I think so.
2723=                             I know I've met with him a few times as my
2724=                representative.
2725=                Q.           Okay.
2726=                A.           Or senator.
2727=                Q.           So Senator Haile was your senator for all of
fmt=pb
2728=                the 2010s, sounds like he was pretty stable in office
2729=                then; correct?
2730=                A.           It's possible.
2731=                Q.           Okay.  Now, as you testified earlier, Senator
2732=                Pody is your current senator?
2733=                A.           Yes.
2734=                Q.           And earlier, because you said that your
2735=                district was gerrymandered, you agree that it's unlikely
2736=                that Senator Pody will lose reelection?
2737=                A.           (Witness moves head up and down.)
2738=                Q.           I'm sorry.  Can you please --
2739=                A.           I think that is a possibility, yes.
2740=                Q.           Okay.  But earlier when you were nodding, you
2741=                were nodding up and down to signify "yes"?
2742=                A.           Yes.
2743=                Q.           So if nonconsecutive numbering upsets you so
2744=                much, why didn't you sue from the late 1990s until 2012,
2745=                when the Davidson County districts weren't consecutively
2746=                numbered?
2747=                A.           I think that, you know, I was starting to pay
2748=                more attention to, like, redistricting.  You know, a lot
2749=                of the work that I've done as a child advocate is helping
2750=                people understand how governments work overall, that they
2751=                do have a representative, how they can meet with those
2752=                representatives and build a relationship with them to help
fmt=pb
2753=                voice what their concerns are to those legislatures so
2754=                they can be heard.
2755=                             And I think that kind of going from just kind
2756=                of that in-person, you know, relationship-building level
2757=                of politicking to actually understanding maps was kind of
2758=                a growth area for me.  And I think probably for the
2759=                community at large -- actually, at least in my circle of
2760=                folks that I'm talking with.
2761=                             So, yeah.  It wasn't until recently that I
2762=                became aware that we were out of sync with the
2763=                Constitution, that that became alarming to me.  And, now,
2764=                even in this session, learning that that's something
2765=                that's been going on over the last few cycles is actually
2766=                pretty disturbing.
2767=                Q.           So you're saying you only know if it's not
2768=                consecutively numbered if you understand the maps?
2769=                A.           I'm sorry.  I don't understand the question.
2770=                Q.           You only understand -- you only know if the
2771=                Davidson County districts are not consecutively numbered
2772=                if you understand the maps?
2773=                A.           I mean, I only know that they're not
2774=                consecutively numbered when I can see the number.
2775=                Q.           Can you see the number on a map?
2776=                A.           Yes.
2777=                             I guess it could be in written form, where
fmt=pb
2778=                it's, like, they say these are the numbers for Davidson
2779=                County.  Then I could just see if they're in sequence or
2780=                not.
2781=                Q.           And if it's in written form or if it's on the
2782=                map, that's the only way you know if it's not
2783=                consecutively numbered?
2784=                A.           Right.
2785=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, I'd like to
2786=                confer with Counsel real quick.
2787=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  You may.
2788=                BY MR. SWATLEY:
2789=                Q.           When did you learn that the Davidson County
2790=                senate districts were not consecutively numbered?
2791=                A.           During the redistricting process, when it got
2792=                voted in.
2793=                Q.           Okay.
2794=                A.           Or decided.  I don't know if it was voted in.
2795=                But . . .
2796=                Q.           Could you be more specific on when?  Do you
2797=                remember a time?
2798=                A.           I think when the maps came out, and within my
2799=                network of friends, we were talking about what that means.
2800=                Q.           Which friends?
2801=                A.           My partner, Skip Brzezienski.
2802=                Q.           Anyone else?
fmt=pb
2803=                A.           Probably our staff at Planned Parenthood.
2804=                Q.           Okay.  Anyone else?
2805=                A.           Well, later on, as we -- as I, you know, got
2806=                involved with this case, you know, we talked about it then
2807=                as well.
2808=                Q.           With who did you talk later on about this?
2809=                A.           I'm trying to remember.  I mean, it's
2810=                pretty -- just through our networks.  It was pretty common
2811=                knowledge that this was an issue.
2812=                Q.           Okay.  Did you talk about this issue with
2813=                Senator Yarbro?
2814=                A.           No.
2815=                             Well, we -- I had talked about whether or not
2816=                I was going to take on this case and if that was going to
2817=                have any unintended consequences.
2818=                Q.           What do you mean by "unintended
2819=                consequences"?
2820=                A.           That if -- because I trust him, and I think
2821=                that if there was any backlash or whatever, that I didn't
2822=                want to be a part of something that would hurt anybody.
2823=                Q.           And I appreciate that explanation, but I'm
2824=                not sure it answers my question.  Let me ask you again.
2825=                             What would the unintended consequences be?
2826=                A.           I think the unintended consequence would be
2827=                whether or not it actually makes a difference.
fmt=pb
2828=                Q.           What would be making a difference?
2829=                A.           Whether or not taking a stand on the
2830=                constitutionality of consecutive districts would matter or
2831=                not.
2832=                Q.           Did you also talk to him because you didn't
2833=                want anything to be inadvertently harmful?
2834=                A.           I wouldn't want to harm him, no.
2835=                Q.           So if he got redistricted out, would that be
2836=                a harm?
2837=                A.           It would be.  And he said that that's a risk
2838=                that he would be willing to take, and that was okay with
2839=                me.
2840=                Q.           And Senator Yarbro, a democrat, being
2841=                redistricted out, is the type of harm you checked on
2842=                before joining this lawsuit?
2843=                A.           Yes.
2844=                Q.           Okay.  Have you been a registered democrat
2845=                since the late '90s?
2846=                A.           I think so.
2847=                Q.           Okay.  And, to your knowledge, was the
2848=                General Assembly in the late 1990s and in the 2000s
2849=                controlled by the democrats?
2850=                A.           I think Governor Bredesen was in office
2851=                during some of the child advocacy that I was doing.
2852=                Q.           And now, as you testified earlier, there's a
fmt=pb
2853=                republican super majority?
2854=                A.           That's right.
2855=                Q.           And now you're bringing a lawsuit, that you
2856=                didn't before?
2857=                A.           That's right.
2858=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  If I may confer with
2859=                Counsel.
2860=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  You may.
2861=                BY MR. SWATLEY:
2862=                Q.           Is the reason you didn't know about the
2863=                nonconsecutive numbering in the 1990s and 2000s, because
2864=                we had a democratic General Assembly and you were a
2865=                democratic voter?
2866=                A.           I mean, there's probably some connection to
2867=                that, yes.  I think that during the time that I was
2868=                raising young children, there was a time, living in
2869=                Nashville, that it felt peaceful.  It felt like there were
2870=                major aspects of politics that I didn't have to, like, sit
2871=                there and drill down and pay attention to that closely.
2872=                             And then as more and more government outreach
2873=                started happening, impacting my life, it kind of forced me
2874=                to have to pay attention to it.
2875=                             I mean, I wouldn't -- even when I came into
2876=                Planned Parenthood, we knew that there were, you know,
2877=                general attacks to bodily sovereignty issues.  But never
fmt=pb
2878=                to the extent -- even --
2879=                             Like, I will tell you, like, I walked across
2880=                the state, from Memphis, all the way to Johnson City.  And
2881=                I talked to people from every walk of life.  And, I mean,
2882=                I talked to Trump supporters and confederate flag bearers
2883=                and, like -- just everyone that you could possibly connect
2884=                with.  Because I was hungry to understand, like, what do
2885=                people actually think about this?
2886=                             I wouldn't normally -- I wouldn't have walked
2887=                across the state a decade ago.  But I did last fall
2888=                because this hurt so badly, this affront to my, you know,
2889=                identity and -- and sovereignty over my own life and
2890=                family, that I really wanted to connect with them.
2891=                             And I think that what I realized, in crossing
2892=                the state, is that people are in the same kind of area of
2893=                awareness that I am, and starting to wake up to a lot of
2894=                the ways in which there's been an abuse of power over our
2895=                rights.  And there's, what I feel, very deeply, is a
2896=                stripping of our voice.
2897=                             And that's why, you know, a decade ago, no, I
2898=                wasn't paying attention to the maps.  But now I am, and I
2899=                think that something should be done about it.
2900=                Q.           So is nonconsecutive numbering of Davidson
2901=                County senate districts only an abuse of power when
2902=                republicans do it?
fmt=pb
2903=                A.           It's when I was aware of it.
2904=                Q.           What, if anything, did Senator Yarbro say
2905=                when you asked him about joining this lawsuit as a
2906=                plaintiff?
2907=                A.           He said that -- he said, "You know what?  It
2908=                may mean that I don't have my office anymore, but you have
2909=                to do what's right."
2910=                Q.           But did you not do the right thing when you
2911=                didn't sue about it when it was not consecutively
2912=                numbered in the '90s?
2913=                A.           I didn't consult with him or even know to do
2914=                anything back in the day.  So, no, I wouldn't have talked
2915=                to him.
2916=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  I'll pass the witness.
2917=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
2918=                                   Redirect?
2919=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  Very short redirect,
2920=                Your Honor.
2921=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Go ahead.
2922=       
2923=                                   REDIRECT EXAMINATION
2924=                BY MR. SPRAGENS:
2925=                Q.           Ms. Hunt, you were asked some questions about
2926=                the 1990s, when you moved here, and the 2000s.
2927=                             Do you know if you even lived in a
fmt=pb
2928=                non-consecutively-numbered senate district during those
2929=                periods of times?
2930=                A.           I didn't.
2931=                Q.           So Exhibit 32, which you were shown, and
2932=                there was that District 23, which is Williamson County,
2933=                sort of encroaching into the bottom of Davidson County,
2934=                you didn't live in that district at the time, did you?
2935=                A.           No.
2936=                Q.           You were asked a lot of questions about your
2937=                political views and beliefs.
2938=                             Are you bringing this lawsuit about a
2939=                constitutional violation because of your political views
2940=                and beliefs?
2941=                A.           I mean, no, in the sense of I see that the
2942=                Constitution, regardless of my personal political views,
2943=                ought to be protected and respected.
2944=                             And, also, yes.  I mean, I think the fact
2945=                that I care deeply about the rights that are being
2946=                stripped away from us made me awake to this problem.
2947=                Q.           Is it fair to say you became aware of the
2948=                violation through the political process and your
2949=                participation in it?
2950=                A.           Yes.
2951=                Q.           Does your political affiliation impact your
2952=                harm as a voter and a resident of Davidson County?
fmt=pb
2953=                A.           Sorry.  Say that one more time.
2954=                Q.           Does the fact that you're politically on one
2955=                side of certain issues impact whether you're harmed as a
2956=                resident of Davidson County?
2957=                A.           Does the -- I'm sorry.  I'm having a hard
2958=                time.  Sorry.
2959=                Q.           That's fine.
2960=                             I'm just asking if the constitutional
2961=                violation that you're alleging here, does that change for
2962=                somebody who is a republican in Davidson County?
2963=                A.           No, it does not.
2964=                Q.           You were asked about expressing your
2965=                individual voice through voting and whether you were given
2966=                the opportunity to do that in this last 2022 election.  Do
2967=                you remember that question?
2968=                A.           Yes.
2969=                Q.           Was that vote cast based on senate maps that
2970=                were drawn in conformance with the Tennessee Constitution?
2971=                A.           In 2022?
2972=                Q.           Yes, ma'am.
2973=                A.           No, it was not.
2974=                Q.           You were asked about the benefit you've been
2975=                deprived of.
2976=                             Did you have the benefit of voting in an
2977=                election using senate districts that were drawn in
fmt=pb
2978=                conformance with the Constitution?
2979=                A.           Well, apparently, no.
2980=                Q.           And you were asked why you didn't sue in the
2981=                1990s, when you first moved to Tennessee, and why you
2982=                didn't sue in the 2000s, when you lived in different parts
2983=                of Davidson County.
2984=                             My question is, are the senate districts
2985=                non-consecutively numbered today in 2023?
2986=                A.           No.
2987=                Q.           Are they non-consecutively numbered?  Are
2988=                they improperly numbered today in 2023?
2989=                A.           That is correct.
2990=                Q.           And were they improperly numbered last year
2991=                in the redistricting process?
2992=                A.           Well, if these are the maps that I just saw,
2993=                apparently, they were also incorrectly draw then.
2994=                Q.           And my question is for 2022, when they
2995=                implemented the new maps.
2996=                             Were they improperly numbered during --
2997=                A.           Yes.
2998=                Q.           -- the 2022 election cycle?
2999=                A.           Yes.  Yes.
3000=                Q.           Does that violate the Tennessee Constitution
3001=                today?
3002=                A.           Yes.
fmt=pb
3003=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Objection.  It's a legal
3004=                conclusion.
3005=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  I'll rephrase that, Your
3006=                Honor.
3007=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Objection sustained.
3008=                BY MR. SPRAGENS:
3009=                Q.           Do you allege, as the plaintiff in this
3010=                lawsuit, that that violates the Tennessee Constitution
3011=                today?
3012=                A.           Yes.
3013=                Q.           And do you allege, as the plaintiff in this
3014=                lawsuit, that that diminishes your voice in the
3015=                legislature today?
3016=                A.           Yes.
3017=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  I don't have any further
3018=                questions.  Thank you, Your Honor.
3019=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Any additional questions?
3020=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Just a couple, Your
3021=                Honor, briefly.
3022=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.
3023=       
3024=                                   RECROSS-EXAMINATION
3025=                BY MR. SWATLEY:
3026=                Q.           I believe earlier you said that the
3027=                nonconsecutive numbering of the senate districts
fmt=pb
3028=                diminishes the voice of you as a voter?
3029=                A.           Yes.
3030=                Q.           How is it diminished?
3031=                A.           Because three out of the four districts in
3032=                Davidson County will be up during a gubernatorial
3033=                election, versus a presidential, where it wouldn't be
3034=                as it should have been created consecutive, where two
3035=                would be during a presidential and two would be during
3036=                gubernatorial, which would mean there would be a little
3037=                bit more fairness in terms of turnout on both sides.
3038=                Q.           And turnout is a choice by the individual
3039=                voter; right?
3040=                A.           It's a choice by the individual voter.
3041=                             Also, contributing factors, external factors,
3042=                such as, you know, billions of dollars are poured into
3043=                political advertising.  A presidential election will bring
3044=                in a lot more attention to folks, so that people
3045=                understand it's an election year.  There's a lot more
3046=                get-out-and-vote opportunities.  There's a lot of voter
3047=                registration opportunities.
3048=                             You know, and so the -- voting also is --
3049=                it's more pronounced during that time.  So there's greater
3050=                awareness.
3051=                Q.           But --
3052=                A.           So it's collective, as well as individual.
fmt=pb
3053=                Q.           So your testimony here today is that the
3054=                right to vote is a collective right?
3055=                A.           Well, it's an individual right.  But I'm
3056=                talking about, like, it's -- I do think it's a collective
3057=                responsibility to help make sure that there's no voter
3058=                suppression, that we have fair elections and
3059=                infrastructure to help people get to the polls.
3060=                Q.           Whether there's an election in a
3061=                gubernatorial year or a presidential year, every
3062=                registered voter who wants to vote can vote; right?
3063=                A.           Not always.  I mean, sometimes there are
3064=                obstacles.  I mean, during COVID, I think there was --
3065=                people had to make special exceptions to be able to vote,
3066=                absentee ballot.  So there are barriers.
3067=                             But, yes.  I mean, individuals can certainly
3068=                make the choice to vote.
3069=                Q.           So it all comes down to choice -- individual
3070=                choice to vote?
3071=                A.           As one aspect.
3072=                Q.           Okay.  So last year, based on your knowledge,
3073=                only one senator in Davidson County, one senate seat
3074=                turned over; right?
3075=                A.           What was -- what's -- oh, I can't ask you a
3076=                question.
3077=                Q.           It's okay.  I'll try to -- it was probably a
fmt=pb
3078=                bad question.  I'll try to rephrase.
3079=                A.           Yeah.
3080=                Q.           Based on your knowledge of the three Davidson
3081=                County senators who were up for reelection last year,
3082=                Senator Pody was reelected, your friend Senator Yarbro was
3083=                reelected, and Senator Charlane Oliver was a new
3084=                incumbent, she was elected?
3085=                A.           Yes.
3086=                Q.           So only one of those seats turned over;
3087=                correct?
3088=                A.           I don't know who the turnover person would
3089=                be.
3090=                Q.           Would it have been Senator Gilmore?
3091=                A.           Oh, because she, yeah, retired.  Yeah.
3092=                Q.           So you weren't deprived of the benefit of
3093=                nonconsecutive numbering last year because only one of
3094=                those seats turned over; right?
3095=                A.           That's correct.
3096=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Okay.  No more questions,
3097=                Your Honor.
3098=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  Nothing further.
3099=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  All right.  You may step
3100=                down.
3101=                                   We're going to take a short break.
3102=                                   And then who is the next witness?
fmt=pb
3103=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  The next witness is Gary
3104=                Wygant, the other plaintiff.
3105=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  All right.  Thank you.
3106=                                   (Recess taken from 12:02 p.m.
3107=                                    to 12:10 p.m.)
3108=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  Our next witness will be
3109=                Plaintiff Gary Wygant.
3110=       
3111=                                      GARY WYGANT,
3112=                was called as a witness, and having been duly sworn, was
3113=                examined and testified as follows:
3114=       
3115=                                   DIRECT EXAMINATION
3116=                BY MR. SPRAGENS:
3117=                Q.           Good morning, Mr. Wygant.
3118=                A.           Good morning.
3119=                Q.           The record will reflect that you and
3120=                Ms. Hunt, before -- you were sworn in before providing
3121=                your testimony; is that right?
3122=                A.           Yes.
3123=                Q.           Would you please introduce yourself to the
3124=                Court and provide a little background about yourself.
3125=                A.           Sure.  I'm Gary Wygant.  I'm a resident of
3126=                Gibson County.  I have been there since 2015, when I
3127=                retired and moved there to live there on the family farm
fmt=pb
3128=                with my wife.
3129=                Q.           What part of the state is Gibson County
3130=                located in?
3131=                A.           Oh, it's -- well, Gibson County, we refer to
3132=                it as the heart of West Tennessee.  With favor to Madison
3133=                County, of course.
3134=                Q.           Is it more rural or urban, would you say?
3135=                A.           You know, it's rural, and we have a lot of
3136=                agriculture there.  But we are growing.  And a lot of that
3137=                is thanks to an expansion of population from the south,
3138=                from Madison.
3139=                Q.           About how long have you lived there, did you
3140=                say?
3141=                A.           I've lived there since 2015, but I've been
3142=                associated with it for close to 40 years because of my
3143=                marriage to an incumbent.
3144=                Q.           I believe you said you were retired.  When
3145=                you were working, what was your profession?
3146=                A.           Right.
3147=                             So for eight and a half years, I worked for
3148=                the Coca-Cola Company.  And I was in the recycling
3149=                business, trying to recycle bottles and cans.  And it was
3150=                a good effort.  We lived in the Atlanta area, in Cobb
3151=                County, Marietta, Georgia, at that time.
3152=                             Prior to that, I worked in the aluminum
fmt=pb
3153=                business, where we made can sheet for beverage cans.  So
3154=                there's a natural affiliation there.
3155=                             So that comprises, really, two retirements
3156=                that I have enjoyed.
3157=                Q.           Since your latest retirement, tell us about
3158=                your involvement in your community.
3159=                A.           Right.
3160=                             So when we finally stopped moving around for
3161=                my work, Janice and I joined a church.  And I'd become
3162=                very active in volunteer work with the church, and am a
3163=                trustee there.  And that takes a little bit of your time.
3164=                I think you know that if they know you're a volunteer and
3165=                you're willing, you get plenty of opportunity to do some
3166=                things.
3167=                             I've also been active with my grandson's
3168=                baseball activities.  And we're currently assistant
3169=                coaching a little league team of 11, 12-year-olds.
3170=                             And let's see.  It was 2020 -- I think it was
3171=                2020 or 2019, I was asked to become more active by some
3172=                members of my church, who were also past executives in the
3173=                Gibson County democratic party.
3174=                             And as such, I've now -- subsequent to that,
3175=                I became more active.  I was interested in the issues that
3176=                were being described.  And I've been elected twice as
3177=                their chairman.  I'm currently chairman of the Gibson
fmt=pb
3178=                County Democratic Party.
3179=                Q.           And, Mr. Wygant, are you registered to vote
3180=                in Gibson County?
3181=                A.           Oh, yes.
3182=                Q.           Do you vote in every election?
3183=                A.           Every one I can, yes.
3184=                Q.           That would include democratic primaries?
3185=                A.           Yes.
3186=                Q.           And, also, general elections at the local,
3187=                state, and federal level?
3188=                A.           Yes.
3189=                Q.           Has that been the case ever since you moved
3190=                to Gibson County?
3191=                A.           Yes, it has.
3192=                Q.           Do you expect to continue voting in elections
3193=                after today's date?
3194=                A.           Yes.
3195=                             And I'll make a plug for early voting.
3196=                Because sometimes election day is not convenient.
3197=                Q.           Who currently represents you in the State
3198=                House of Representatives?
3199=                A.           I live in the newly-divided Gibson County.  I
3200=                happen to have landed in District 79, which was my prior
3201=                district, when all of Gibson County was in District 79.
3202=                             And our representative is recently elected,
fmt=pb
3203=                Brock Martin.  And I believe he lives somewhere east of
3204=                Huntingdon, in Carroll or Henderson County.
3205=                Q.           What about the other portion of Gibson
3206=                County, the part you don't live --
3207=                A.           Right.
3208=                Q.           -- what district is that, and who represents
3209=                it?
3210=                A.           So that's District 82.  And, roughly, half of
3211=                our voters are in District 82.  Rough numbers because I
3212=                don't have specifics.  And the representative there is
3213=                Chris Hurt.  And he's from Halls, Tennessee.  At least he
3214=                went to high school there.
3215=                             And so we have two representatives for our
3216=                county, depending on which half of the county you happen
3217=                to be in.
3218=                Q.           And how would you say the county is divided,
3219=                just geographically?  You know, where does -- how does the
3220=                line go through the county?
3221=                A.           Yeah.  It's, like, right down the spine.  If
3222=                you take Highway 45 down, it pretty well -- Highway 45
3223=                West, it pretty well divides that way.  And then with a
3224=                little jog at the bottom, out of Medina.  So it's -- well,
3225=                the --
3226=                             There were some words to describe maps.  But
3227=                you'd have to look at it to -- and I'm sure we have a
fmt=pb
3228=                display of it -- to see how the new redistricting changed
3229=                the shape of District 79, and introduced us into
3230=                District 82.
3231=                Q.           So let's talk about that.
3232=                             Prior to the 2022 redistricting, how did
3233=                District 79 look geographically and with respect to Gibson
3234=                County?
3235=                A.           Right.
3236=                             So Gibson County -- in the prior District 79,
3237=                Gibson County was whole.  And on its east, Carroll County
3238=                was attached, about two-thirds of Carroll County, about 60
3239=                to 70 percent of Carroll County geographically.  And that
3240=                was District 79 prior to the redistricting.
3241=                Q.           You said your current representative is not
3242=                from Gibson County.  Can you explain a little bit more
3243=                about where your current representative is located
3244=                relative to Trenton and Gibson County?
3245=                A.           Right.
3246=                             It's about -- I don't know his home address.
3247=                But Brock Martin is a chiropractor in Carroll, and I
3248=                believe in Henderson County.  I'm not sure where all of
3249=                his offices are.  But I believe he lives in the Henderson
3250=                area.
3251=                Q.           Okay.
3252=                A.           Or Huntingdon area.  I'm sorry.
fmt=pb
3253=                Q.           And District 79, the one you described
3254=                earlier, is encompassing, you know, Gibson and a piece of
3255=                Carroll, how is it shaped now?
3256=                A.           Wow.
3257=                             When I visualize it, okay, it's half of
3258=                Gibson County.  It takes the same kind of bottom half or
3259=                portion of Carroll County.  And then it grabs Henderson
3260=                County over here.  So it's a -- the shape of it is a
3261=                little like that, as I'm drawing it with my hand.
3262=                             The other half, the 82, is a little bit more
3263=                shapey, if you will.  It's got Obion County above it.  Or
3264=                a portion of, if not all.
3265=                             The western half of Gibson County, Crockett
3266=                County, and Lauderdale county.  So District 82 goes all
3267=                the way to the Mississippi River.
3268=                             So if you're a resident in District 82, your
3269=                current representative is living out toward Halls, out
3270=                that way, quite a distance from Gibson County.
3271=                             So, in both cases, we have representatives
3272=                who are recently elected, who are not residents in Gibson
3273=                County, which is a big change for us.
3274=                Q.           Before redistricting, when Gibson County was
3275=                entirely in District 79, did you have regular interactions
3276=                with your representative?
3277=                A.           I'd say as much social as otherwise.  You
fmt=pb
3278=                know, one of the benefits of the way that we had it in
3279=                Gibson County was that you --
3280=                             And, by the way, Representative Curtis
3281=                Halford, who retired and opened up that seat, was in close
3282=                proximity to Trenton, where I also live.  So we have, you
3283=                know, occasion to see each other socially.  His wife is
3284=                involved in community theater, and we support that.  So we
3285=                would see them there.  We would see them at other events,
3286=                such as charity events.  I recently saw him last August at
3287=                the Gibson County Fair, for example.
3288=                             So, you know, Mr. Halford was and is out and
3289=                about in the community.  Yes.
3290=                Q.           When he was serving, was he a democrat or a
3291=                republican?
3292=                A.           He's a republican.
3293=                Q.           But you still saw him in all those circles?
3294=                A.           Sure.
3295=                Q.           What about after redistricting?  Do you see
3296=                the legislators who represent Gibson County in your
3297=                community?
3298=                A.           I have.
3299=                             I can tell you I have seen Representative
3300=                Martin, who was recently elected.  I have seen him several
3301=                times at -- again, at events, if you will, in Gibson
3302=                County.
fmt=pb
3303=                             I have not seen Representative Hurt at events
3304=                in Gibson County.  So I don't know what his frequency
3305=                might be.
3306=                Q.           Let's talk a little bit about the impact of
3307=                the redistricting on Gibson County from your standpoint.
3308=                A.           Okay.  Right.
3309=                Q.           What have you perceived, under the new
3310=                configuration, in terms of Gibson County's ability to get
3311=                things done in the legislature?
3312=                A.           Right.
3313=                             So you probably would be aware, but we're
3314=                quite proud in Gibson County that we've finally crossed a
3315=                threshold here in the latest census of 50,000 residents.
3316=                And that has quite a bit of meaning in terms of the
3317=                attention that we get in funding for our county
3318=                activities.  In fact, some of our county officials got a
3319=                raise out of that, which was kind of nice for them.  But
3320=                it put more attention on Gibson County.
3321=                             You might also be aware that we now have
3322=                Tyson Foods, who's moved into Humboldt, who have brought a
3323=                lot of commerce to Gibson County.  And we have a lot of
3324=                chicken barns and chicken trucks and a big expansion of
3325=                feed capacity in Gibson County for Tyson Foods.
3326=                             We're also proximate enough to the BlueOval
3327=                expansion that issues, like, traffic, like roads and
fmt=pb
3328=                bridges, like housing, municipal issues that expand out
3329=                into non-municipal areas.
3330=                             Gibson County is slated to grow.  It's been
3331=                growing.  And it's going to be continuing.
3332=                             The concern with regard to the redistricting
3333=                that I have heard and continue to be concerned about is
3334=                that our representation is fractured from an east/west
3335=                perspective in the redistricting.
3336=                             So if we've got an issue that pertains to
3337=                Gibson County, who do we call?  We've got to call both and
3338=                say, "Hey, we have an issue we need to address, we want
3339=                you to address."
3340=                             The other, I think, concern that I have about
3341=                the redistricting is that from the outset of
3342=                redistricting, it caused confusion for the voters.  Right
3343=                up to the day of election, we were trying to educate
3344=                people about what it meant that they got a new voter card,
3345=                that they no longer were in District 79, that they might
3346=                be in District 82, and that they need to look toward Halls
3347=                to get representation.
3348=                Q.           In another context, I think you used the word
3349=                "disenfranchisement" to describe this.  Can you explain
3350=                what you mean by that?
3351=                A.           Right.
3352=                             So probably not unique to Gibson County.  But
fmt=pb
3353=                what I've learned, through my long association with, and
3354=                now finally moving there eight or nine years ago, is that
3355=                people have a great deal of pride in Gibson County.
3356=                             There's civic pride, but there's also county
3357=                pride.  They -- they're proud of their county, like
3358=                nowhere else.  And they want things to keep going the way
3359=                that they've appreciated throughout their life.
3360=                             This redistricting came as a shock and a
3361=                surprise to people.  Because we always had Chris Crider
3362=                or, you know, preceding, Representative Halford.  And all
3363=                of a sudden, people were, like, "Well, what happened?  Do
3364=                we vote now?"
3365=                             We got that question often.  "What are we
3366=                voting for?"
3367=                             This also came on the heels of redistricting
3368=                locally in the county.  Because the census also
3369=                actioned -- I referenced growth.  Gibson County grew.  It
3370=                did not just grow 1,000 people, so that we surpassed
3371=                50,000.  But the distribution of that changed.  Some of
3372=                our more rural areas had a decline.  Some of our growing
3373=                suburban areas, like Medina, exploded; right?  Again,
3374=                expansion from Madison County.
3375=                             So what was happening is the county
3376=                commission had a task that's been described this morning
3377=                as an analytical task to redistrict.  And when that became
fmt=pb
3378=                apparent, that we were going to be redistricting, I took
3379=                an active role in monitoring what was going on so that I
3380=                could communicate it to the voters.
3381=                             And what I learned is that, indeed, it's a
3382=                complex process.  Even at little old county level.  We've
3383=                got 19 county districts.  Nobody wants to see a change in
3384=                their county district.  In our county, maybe 30 percent of
3385=                the people did see a change in their county district.
3386=                             But because we took involvement, we were able
3387=                to observe what was happening.  I myself went to the
3388=                analytical presentations by the State-provided experts
3389=                that performed the analysis.  And, indeed, while quite
3390=                complex, they boiled it down to choices.  They said, "We
3391=                can do this with these 19 districts, and provide the
3392=                equity, and meet the standards that we work within, and
3393=                the guardrails that we have federally and statewide.  And
3394=                these are the choices that we've presented to the
3395=                commission."
3396=                             And the committee and the commission came
3397=                back and, again, in public meeting, explained that to
3398=                whoever went.  And I was there and said, "This is how we
3399=                believe it's most fairly represented."
3400=                             Now, you may have also heard of a little old
3401=                town called Skullbone.  Well, Skullbone in Gibson County
3402=                is a place with -- they are probably the exemplary town
fmt=pb
3403=                for civic pride.  They did not want to lose their polling
3404=                place.
3405=                             And so as a result of negotiations that
3406=                occurred at the commission meeting, discussions with the
3407=                election commission, who were also there, and I also
3408=                observed that, that there was a coordinated response that
3409=                made sense to everyone who took involvement, and was
3410=                explainable to the voters; right?
3411=                             So when we sat down in voter meetings and
3412=                said, "This is how we -- this is how your representatives
3413=                redistricted, and we were there to observe it, and it was
3414=                transparent," you know, the one question I continued to
3415=                get was, "Do you think it was done fairly?"
3416=                             All right.  Now, I'm no expert; right?  But I
3417=                was there.  And what I observed was done according to the
3418=                law, and done transparently, done in a way that's
3419=                understandable to the common voter, and, ultimately,
3420=                resulted in an opportunity for people to go out and
3421=                exercise their option and vote.
3422=                             So, yeah, it makes a difference in Gibson
3423=                County.
3424=                Q.           So that was a local -- you're testifying
3425=                about local districts?
3426=                A.           That's right, yes.
3427=                Q.           Did you have any involvement in the state
fmt=pb
3428=                house and senate redistricting process?
3429=                A.           I tried.  I tried contacting my
3430=                representative, Representative Halford.  And he was not
3431=                involved.
3432=                             When I was able to get a response about,
3433=                "Well, what's happening with redistricting for our county
3434=                and our District 79," the answer that I unfortunately got
3435=                was that our representative was uninvolved and unaware.
3436=                He could not tell me what the process was and how it was
3437=                going.  And I could not deliver that to our voters.  I
3438=                couldn't tell members of my party, or for that matter,
3439=                anyone else.
3440=                             I'd like to add to that, that, you know, it's
3441=                a small town, trying to -- the chairman of the republican
3442=                party is also a member of the same church I go to.  So I
3443=                know him quite well, Pat Reilly.
3444=                             And I asked Pat, I said, "Pat, are you aware
3445=                of what's happening?"
3446=                             And he said, "No.  All I know is the
3447=                committee is operating under" --
3448=                                   MS. HOLLARS:  Objection.  Hearsay, Your
3449=                Honor.
3450=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  Your Honor, if I could
3451=                respond.  I don't think this goes to the truth of the
3452=                matter asserted.  This is about notice and the effect on
fmt=pb
3453=                the redistricting process.
3454=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  We'll allow a little of
3455=                it.  But we do need to be careful about that.
3456=                BY MR. SPRAGENS:
3457=                Q.           Okay.  Go ahead, if you want to just complete
3458=                your testimony there.
3459=                A.           Okay.  Well, what I was driving at was that
3460=                neither I, nor others that I queried, were aware of how
3461=                the process was going or that the outcome would result in
3462=                a split of our county into two districts.
3463=                Q.           Mr. Wygant, were you aware of any hearings
3464=                held in Gibson County or nearby about the state
3465=                redistricting effort?
3466=                A.           No.
3467=                Q.           Were you aware of any hearings being held in
3468=                Nashville that you were invited to participate in about
3469=                that effort?
3470=                A.           No.
3471=                Q.           If those hearings had been held, would you
3472=                have gone as a resident of Gibson County and a chair of
3473=                the democratic party?
3474=                A.           I would have made an effort, yes.
3475=                Q.           In the new division of Gibson County, in your
3476=                role as party chair, did the democratic party have
3477=                candidates to field for those seats?
fmt=pb
3478=                A.           So we fielded a candidate, who was also a
3479=                party officer, from Henderson County.  His name was Thomas
3480=                Jefferson, II.  And Thomas ran against Brock Martin for
3481=                District 79.
3482=                             He was unsuccessful in that bid.  And -- but
3483=                we were very proud of fielding a candidate.  We were not
3484=                able to muster a candidate from Gibson County for
3485=                District 82.  So Mr. Hurt ran unopposed.
3486=                Q.           And the incumbent that you mentioned you
3487=                spoke with about trying to get information about
3488=                redistricting, did he run again?
3489=                A.           No.  Curtis Halford retired.  He had
3490=                announced in advance that he was going to.  So we all knew
3491=                that.
3492=                Q.           And did he announce that before the decision
3493=                was announced that Gibson County would be split in half?
3494=                A.           Yes.  I believe so.  I believe it was
3495=                generally known that he was retiring.
3496=                Q.           And so there was no incumbent losing a seat
3497=                in that redistricting; is that correct?
3498=                A.           Yes.
3499=                Q.           You're here today as a plaintiff in a
3500=                lawsuit.  What's your understanding of the allegations
3501=                you're making about the house redistricting?
3502=                A.           Well, first of all, I think you can figure
fmt=pb
3503=                out I'm not a constitutional scholar.  But I can read it,
3504=                and I know that it says that we shouldn't divide counties.
3505=                             I'm also aware, from discussing the case,
3506=                that there's been subsequent decisions that have been
3507=                taken that mitigate that to some degree.
3508=                             So I am aware that some divisions had been
3509=                made, and I'm very aware of the recent decisions that were
3510=                made on redistricting.
3511=                Q.           Are you -- in your role as a plaintiff in
3512=                this lawsuit, are you just challenging the redistricting
3513=                of Gibson County?
3514=                A.           No.  It's a -- the word "puzzle" was used
3515=                earlier in the testimony, and it very much is.
3516=                             There's 99 pieces to this puzzle.  And it --
3517=                not only am I concerned that Gibson County was divided,
3518=                I'm concerned that other counties were divided.
3519=                             And unlike the, I think, wonderful and
3520=                exemplary job that was done in the county for this same
3521=                exercise at a lower level, that this all seems to have
3522=                been done under a cloak of secrecy.  Not even my
3523=                representative could advise me how I could learn more, how
3524=                I could be a part of this.  So I felt very damaged by
3525=                that.
3526=                Q.           And, Mr. Wygant, if you are successful in
3527=                this lawsuit, what are you asking this Court to order the
fmt=pb
3528=                legislature to do?
3529=                A.           I think they need to do the job correctly.  I
3530=                think it needs to be lawful.  It needs to respect the
3531=                Constitution.  And, of course, subsequent case law.
3532=                             But I think, more than anything, it needs to
3533=                be open.  People need to know what's happening.  They need
3534=                to see what's happening.  We're not analysts, but we
3535=                understand when someone is hiding information, apparently,
3536=                not telling us what's going on while it's happening.
3537=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  At this time, I'll pass
3538=                the witness.
3539=                                   Thank you, Mr. Wygant.
3540=       
3541=                                    CROSS-EXAMINATION
3542=                BY MS. HOLLARS:
3543=                Q.           Good afternoon, Mr. Wygant.  I'm Amy Hollars,
3544=                and I have just a few questions for you this afternoon on
3545=                behalf of the defendants.
3546=                A.           Okay.
3547=                Q.           Mr. Wygant, you moved to Gibson County in
3548=                2015; is that correct?
3549=                A.           Correct.
3550=                Q.           So you've lived there about eight years?
3551=                A.           That's right.
3552=                Q.           And you only claim residence in Gibson
fmt=pb
3553=                County; correct?
3554=                A.           That's correct.
3555=                Q.           And, Mr. Wygant, have you voted in just about
3556=                every election since you moved to Gibson County in 2015?
3557=                A.           Yes.
3558=                Q.           From the time that you moved to Gibson County
3559=                in 2015, until the 2022 redistricting plan came into
3560=                effect, you were in House District 79; correct?
3561=                A.           That's correct.
3562=                Q.           And you're still in House District 79 --
3563=                A.           That's correct.
3564=                Q.           -- under the new redistricting plan?
3565=                A.           That is correct.
3566=                Q.           But the new map changed your district; is
3567=                that correct?
3568=                A.           Yes.
3569=                Q.           All right.  And it split Gibson County?
3570=                A.           It did.
3571=                Q.           Now, you acknowledge there are decisions that
3572=                have to be made in the process of redistricting that could
3573=                cause counties to have to be divided; correct?
3574=                A.           Yes.
3575=                Q.           And, in fact, you testified that you
3576=                understand and agree that some counties may require
3577=                division, to follow the law; is that correct?
fmt=pb
3578=                A.           Yes.
3579=                Q.           But your alleged harm is that Gibson County
3580=                was divided when it did not need to be?
3581=                A.           Yes.
3582=                Q.           Okay.  Mr. Wygant, you've also testified that
3583=                you don't have an opinion about Shelby County
3584=                redistricting; is that correct?
3585=                A.           I haven't studied the situation in Shelby
3586=                County, or experienced it.
3587=                Q.           Do you recall when Mr. Alex Rieger took your
3588=                deposition back in August --
3589=                A.           In August.
3590=                Q.           Do you recall he asked you whether you had an
3591=                opinion about redistricting in Shelby County?
3592=                A.           I recall him asking, yes.
3593=                Q.           Do you recall your response at that time?
3594=                A.           Not as I'm sitting here, no.
3595=                Q.           Okay.  Would it surprise you to learn that
3596=                you said you didn't have an opinion about it at that time?
3597=                A.           No, it doesn't surprise me.
3598=                Q.           Okay.  Well, do you have an opinion about
3599=                redistricting in any other counties?
3600=                A.           More and more, yes.  As I educate myself on
3601=                what's happening and I see the impact that redistricting
3602=                is having.
fmt=pb
3603=                Q.           Mr. Wygant, which one specifically do you
3604=                have an opinion about?
3605=                A.           Which --
3606=                Q.           Which --
3607=                A.           Is that plural?
3608=                Q.           Which counties or which districts do you have
3609=                an opinion about the redistricting process?
3610=                A.           Okay.  I understand the question.
3611=                             So for me personally, my opinion is now
3612=                inclusive of the counties that have been attached to the
3613=                county that I represent as chairman of the democratic
3614=                party.
3615=                             So, now, Lauderdale County, Crockett County,
3616=                Obion County, Henderson County have been added to the
3617=                counties that now I have to pay attention in some way to
3618=                what's happening there in order to work with legislators
3619=                with regard to what's happening in Gibson County and what
3620=                could happen in Gibson County.
3621=                Q.           Okay.  And, for example, you don't live in
3622=                Anderson County; correct?
3623=                A.           No.  No.
3624=                Q.           And do you have any opinion about the
3625=                division of the county in Anderson County?
3626=                A.           I have a categoric opinion about
3627=                redistricting that affects other counties in Tennessee.
fmt=pb
3628=                Q.           Well, whenever there is a division, which you
3629=                have testified sometimes has to occur to follow other
3630=                rules, whenever that occurs, is it your opinion that the
3631=                remaining portions of the county are very damaged, as you
3632=                described your feeling after Gibson County was split?
3633=                A.           Right.  So -- so I can -- I can answer, I
3634=                think, in this way.
3635=                             What happened to me and what happened to
3636=                Gibson County is happening elsewhere in Tennessee.  We
3637=                know that.  And I don't think it's a broad speculation
3638=                that there are people there that feel exactly the way I
3639=                feel and are asking the question, "Why was this not done
3640=                in a manner that I could participate?"
3641=                Q.           So, Mr. Wygant, do you feel, personally, the
3642=                impact of the split of Anderson County?
3643=                A.           Not like I would if I lived there.
3644=                Q.           So the claim that you articulated in the
3645=                complaint focuses on the Gibson County split; correct?
3646=                A.           It's foremost in my mind.  It's the
3647=                experience I have.
3648=                Q.           And not on the split of any other counties in
3649=                the newly-enacted house map?
3650=                A.           You're describing an exclusion.  I don't
3651=                exclude what's happening around the state, in my opinion.
3652=                Q.           So my question, though, is, your claim, as
fmt=pb
3653=                articulated in your complaint, does that complaint -- in
3654=                that complaint, are you focusing on a split in any other
3655=                counties in the newly-enacted house map?
3656=                A.           I believe the newly-enacted redistricting map
3657=                is just as unfair to other divided counties as Gibson
3658=                County.
3659=                Q.           Do you have any individual and personal
3660=                impact from the division in those other counties?
3661=                A.           Well, I do hear about it from the other
3662=                county chairmen, yes.  But that's really them relaying
3663=                their feelings.
3664=                Q.           Mr. Wygant, you referred to what you felt was
3665=                a lack of transparency in the process.
3666=                             Did you ever request to address the General
3667=                Assembly with your concerns about redistricting?
3668=                A.           No.
3669=                Q.           Did you know of anyone at Gibson County who
3670=                did so?
3671=                A.           I tried to connect with Representative
3672=                Halford to find out how I could raise a complaint, what I
3673=                could do about it.  And he told me he didn't know how I
3674=                could, it was a done deal.
3675=                Q.           So, Mr. Wygant, you are active in local
3676=                politics; correct?
3677=                A.           Yes.
fmt=pb
3678=                Q.           And have been elected two times as the chair
3679=                of your local democratic party in Gibson County?
3680=                A.           Yes.  Yes.
3681=                Q.           So you are tuned in to the political process,
3682=                aren't you, Mr. Wygant?
3683=                A.           As much as I can, yes.
3684=                Q.           And you read the local papers?
3685=                A.           I do.
3686=                Q.           And do you read any kind of a statewide or a
3687=                paper out of Nashville?
3688=                A.           I don't have a subscription to the
3689=                Tennesseean, but I sometimes see articles that cover
3690=                the --
3691=                Q.           And you read articles online about political
3692=                issues and --
3693=                A.           Sometimes, yes.
3694=                Q.           But redistricting got by you?
3695=                A.           No.  I can't say it got by me.  But all the
3696=                inquiries that I made fell short of delivering an answer
3697=                as to how can I get involved.
3698=                Q.           Mr. Wygant, you described having access and
3699=                kind of a familiarity with your former representative,
3700=                Curtis Halford; correct?
3701=                A.           Yes.  Yes.
3702=                Q.           And he retired?
fmt=pb
3703=                A.           He did.
3704=                Q.           So there's nothing necessarily about this
3705=                redistricting that affected your choice not to have Curtis
3706=                Halford as your representative anymore?
3707=                A.           Curtis Halford took that decision.
3708=                Q.           Okay.  And he was from your home -- he's from
3709=                Gibson County; correct?
3710=                A.           He is.
3711=                Q.           Now, before the split, how was your -- I
3712=                think you described how the District 79 was configured.
3713=                A.           Yes.
3714=                Q.           And that district also included a large
3715=                portion of Carroll County?
3716=                A.           Yes, it does.  About 60 percent.
3717=                Q.           It did before?
3718=                A.           Yes.
3719=                Q.           And even before Representative Halford
3720=                decided not to run again, your representative could have
3721=                come from Carroll County, just as easily?
3722=                A.           The requirement is to live in the district.
3723=                So, sure.
3724=                Q.           So in terms of access and familiarity, that's
3725=                always a risk, isn't it, when you have a multicounty
3726=                district?
3727=                             In other words, the candidate may not be from
fmt=pb
3728=                your home county?
3729=                A.           Especially now.
3730=                Q.           Do you -- you referred to the fact that you
3731=                felt disenfranchised by the fact that the representative,
3732=                Brock Martin, is not from Gibson County and that
3733=                Representative Hurt is not from the other half of Gibson
3734=                County.
3735=                             But you did vote in the last election;
3736=                correct?
3737=                A.           I did.
3738=                Q.           Nothing prevented you from that?
3739=                A.           Correct.
3740=                Q.           So in a county -- or in a district that has
3741=                multiple parts, multiple county constituents in a
3742=                district, there's always the risk that the candidate
3743=                elected is not going to be from your home county, isn't
3744=                that correct?
3745=                A.           Yes.
3746=                Q.           Okay.  Could it be that having two separate
3747=                representatives who are representing Gibson County within
3748=                their districts, that they could work together and have
3749=                greater influence than a single representative, in
3750=                promoting the interest of Gibson County?
3751=                A.           I don't know.
3752=                Q.           Okay.  So, clearly, Mr. Wygant, your
fmt=pb
3753=                preference is that Gibson County remain intact, is that it
3754=                would have remained intact in the last redistricting?
3755=                A.           Yeah.  It certainly is an animating issue for
3756=                me and for my party in Gibson County.  It's defined by the
3757=                county.
3758=                             So in terms of my representation of about
3759=                8,000 democrats in Gibson County, the answer is they want
3760=                their county -- their representative to represent the
3761=                whole county.
3762=                             For me, in terms of the broader issue,
3763=                personally, I find this offensive and damaging to the
3764=                credibility of my state, that this process, which could be
3765=                done, handled by local county commissioners, couldn't be
3766=                handled in the same open and equitable way by elected
3767=                representatives in the state house.
3768=                Q.           Have you done any investigation into the
3769=                processes and the opportunities for public comment in this
3770=                redistricting process?
3771=                A.           In the one that just happened --
3772=                Q.           Yes.
3773=                A.           -- in January?  No.
3774=                Q.           Okay.  So why do you assert, then, that
3775=                there's a lack of transparency, if you have not looked
3776=                into that?
3777=                A.           There's -- well, I take exception to my --
fmt=pb
3778=                the characterization that I took no interest.  I asked my
3779=                representative, and he couldn't help me.  Who else should
3780=                I ask?  You ask the guy who's representing you now, "What
3781=                am I supposed to do?"
3782=                             And he says, "Sorry.  It's behind closed
3783=                doors, and I'm not a part of it, and I can't help you."
3784=                Q.           Okay.  So that's based -- your assertion is
3785=                based upon that conversation that you had with
3786=                Representative Halford, saying, "It's already done"?
3787=                A.           And, also, other conversations anecdotally by
3788=                others with the same --
3789=                Q.           I'm not going to ask you about those.
3790=                A.           Okay.
3791=                Q.           Now, Mr. Wygant, you said that in your
3792=                capacity as the democratic chair in Gibson County, that
3793=                you -- I think you said you represented about 8,000
3794=                democrats that were voting in that area; is that correct?
3795=                A.           That's our best count, yes.
3796=                Q.           Is your opposition to this redistricting map
3797=                for the House -- redistricting map for the House, is it --
3798=                does it come from a political perspective?
3799=                A.           I think one of the things you have to know
3800=                about Gibson County is we have 30,000, and we have about
3801=                8,000 democrats.  This division doesn't change the
3802=                distribution in a way that would influence an election
fmt=pb
3803=                within the county.
3804=                Q.           So it doesn't affect the --
3805=                A.           Not in terms of within the county.
3806=                Q.           Okay.  So you discussed, Mr. Wygant, your
3807=                feelings about Gibson County being a tight-knit community
3808=                and that they had some common interests in dealing with
3809=                the challenges of growth in the future?
3810=                A.           Yes.
3811=                Q.           Okay.  So core preservation of Gibson County
3812=                is important to you, isn't it?
3813=                A.           I need a definition of "core preservation."
3814=                Q.           Okay.  So -- well, is it important to you,
3815=                that in redistricting house -- your house district, 79,
3816=                that it be kept substantially the same as it was before
3817=                the 2022 redistricting process?
3818=                A.           Yeah.
3819=                             So I think I can speak for myself and for
3820=                others in Gibson County who resist changes; right?  I'd
3821=                always like to say things stay the same.  But I accept
3822=                that change does happen.  And that within the confines of
3823=                the redistricting rules that I observed at the county
3824=                level, that there are choices that are made.
3825=                Q.           Would you agree that the legislature should
3826=                afford weight to keeping the district as close as possible
3827=                as to -- as the previous version of the district?
fmt=pb
3828=                A.           Well, as I testified to earlier,
3829=                constitutionally, it should be every county; right?
3830=                             But with the mitigations that have happened,
3831=                it should just be as few times as possible in
3832=                redistricting, that we have to answer the question about a
3833=                divided county.
3834=                Q.           Okay.  Mr. Wygant, I'm going to refer you to
3835=                one of the exhibits that is in your notebook there.  And
3836=                it's the one that would have 105 in it.
3837=                A.           Okay.  I'm going to need help.
3838=                Q.           I'm going to pass over to you, for ease, if I
3839=                could, this document.  And it shows populations of the
3840=                split counties.
3841=                A.           Okay.
3842=                                   MS. HOLLARS:  And, Your Honors, this
3843=                was an exhibit that was agreed upon would be admissible.
3844=                And it is 105.
3845=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  What's the exhibit
3846=                number?  105 is the tab; right?
3847=                                   MS. HOLLARS:  105 is the tab.
3848=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibit 20 is admitted by
3849=                agreement.
3850=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  So 105, Your Honor, our
3851=                position is it shouldn't be admitted as just demonstrative
3852=                evidence.  Exhibit 20 is a different matter.  If they want
fmt=pb
3853=                to hand the witness Exhibit 20, no objection.
3854=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Well, now, 105 would
3855=                be --
3856=                                   MS. HOLLARS:  I'm using it for
3857=                demonstrative purposes, in any case.
3858=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.  So Exhibit 20 will
3859=                be marked for identification purposes only until it's
3860=                offered.  And then if it's offered, we'll hear any
3861=                objection to it.
3862=                                   (Marked Exhibit 20, for
3863=                identification.)
3864=                BY MS. HOLLARS:
3865=                Q.           The demonstrative is based upon the table,
3866=                which is Exhibit 20.  And we'll mark this for ID.
3867=                             Mr. Wygant, the copy that I sent over to you
3868=                is colorful, and it has -- it's titled:  Populations of
3869=                Split Counties.
3870=                             Correct?
3871=                A.           It says:  2022 County Population Split
3872=                Counties.
3873=                Q.           Okay.  So do you know, in -- according to the
3874=                last census, the 2020 census, do you know what the
3875=                population -- the average population for our districts in
3876=                Tennessee should be?
3877=                A.           Not off the top of my head, no.
fmt=pb
3878=                Q.           Do you -- you know that your county has just
3879=                surpassed the 50,000-person mark; correct?
3880=                A.           Yes.  Yes.
3881=                Q.           Okay.  So if the number -- population number
3882=                for districts is 68,900, roughly, would it be correct that
3883=                none of the counties currently in the 2022 redistricted 79
3884=                would have enough population to make up a single district
3885=                by itself?  So I'm asking about Gibson, Carroll, and
3886=                Henderson.
3887=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  Your Honor, I would just
3888=                object to -- if she's asking about his personal knowledge,
3889=                that's fine.  If she's asking him to read an exhibit that
3890=                hasn't been authenticated, I would object to that.
3891=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  I will allow the
3892=                question, and the witness can answer it, if you will.
3893=                BY MS. HOLLARS:
3894=                Q.           If you can, sir.
3895=                A.           I am aware, from this document and from
3896=                internet search, that none of the individual counties --
3897=                Carroll, Gibson, or Henderson -- is above the 69,000
3898=                number that you posed in the question.
3899=                Q.           Okay.  So if you added any two of those
3900=                counties together, without splitting them --
3901=                A.           Yes.
3902=                Q.           -- wouldn't you exceed the goal redistricting
fmt=pb
3903=                number?
3904=                A.           If these numbers are used in the discussion,
3905=                Gibson and Carroll County would equal 78,000 and some
3906=                change.
3907=                Q.           So that would be too great, if we used the
3908=                68,900 figure as --
3909=                A.           It would be more than.
3910=                Q.           Yes.
3911=                             So you couldn't simply just add those two
3912=                counties together without doing some split?
3913=                A.           If 69,000 was the number, yes.
3914=                Q.           Do you know if any of the other redistricting
3915=                plans that were provided to the General Assembly during
3916=                the redistricting process kept Gibson County intact?
3917=                A.           I do not know.  The process was opaque to me.
3918=                Q.           Okay.  And, Mr. Wygant, you testified that
3919=                you had no reason to think you wouldn't have similar
3920=                values and interests to those persons in the additional
3921=                counties that were added to District 79, didn't you?
3922=                A.           I'm not sure.  Would you pose that once more
3923=                for me?
3924=                Q.           So did you testify that you had no reason to
3925=                think you wouldn't have similar values and interests to
3926=                the persons from Henderson and Carroll County that were
3927=                added to District 79?
fmt=pb
3928=                A.           Are you referring to my deposition?
3929=                Q.           I am.
3930=                A.           Okay.  I may have said that.
3931=                Q.           Okay.  Do you feel the same way today?
3932=                A.           I'm a little more educated now.  I think that
3933=                we have one very simple interest in common, is that we
3934=                want to know about the decision and how the decision was
3935=                made to divide our county.  And if we were aware of that,
3936=                then we might feel better about accepting it.
3937=                             I've spoken to my counterparts in both of
3938=                those counties, and their constituents echo that same
3939=                point of view.
3940=                Q.           Mr. Wygant, you already told us that you
3941=                didn't have an opportunity -- or you didn't attend a
3942=                hearing before the General Assembly; correct?
3943=                A.           Correct.
3944=                Q.           And did you submit a map electronically by
3945=                computer?
3946=                A.           To whom?
3947=                Q.           Did you know that there was an opportunity to
3948=                do that in the redistricting process?
3949=                A.           I did not.
3950=                Q.           Okay.  So you did not submit a map?
3951=                A.           I didn't know.  I didn't submit.
3952=                Q.           Did you contact any other legislators about
fmt=pb
3953=                the redistricting process?
3954=                A.           I don't recall contacting another
3955=                legislature.
3956=                Q.           And do you know how your former
3957=                representative, Mr. Halford, voted on the enacted plan?
3958=                A.           I'm trying to remember, but I can't recall.
3959=                Q.           Did anyone within the democratic party you're
3960=                familiar with submit a map?
3961=                A.           Not to my knowledge.  I don't know.
3962=                Q.           Did you contact anyone to submit a map?
3963=                A.           I called my representative, and I e-mailed
3964=                her.
3965=                Q.           Okay.  Did you contact anyone within the
3966=                democratic party to submit a map during that process?
3967=                A.           No.
3968=                Q.           And did you -- strike that, please.
3969=                                   MS. HOLLARS:  No further questions.
3970=                Thank you, Mr. Wygant.
3971=                                   THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
3972=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  Just a brief redirect,
3973=                Your Honor.
3974=       
3975=                                   REDIRECT EXAMINATION
3976=                BY MR. SPRAGENS:
3977=                Q.           Mr. Wygant, you were asked questions about
fmt=pb
3978=                your opinions about county splits.  Do you remember those
3979=                questions?
3980=                A.           Yes.
3981=                Q.           Your opinion about Gibson County's split and
3982=                other county splits on the map, do you recall those
3983=                questions?
3984=                A.           Yes.
3985=                Q.           Are you an expert on redistricting?
3986=                A.           No.
3987=                Q.           Are you an expert on mapmaking for house
3988=                districts in a state?
3989=                A.           No.
3990=                Q.           Do you have any special knowledge of the
3991=                factors under Tennessee law that should be considered in
3992=                the redistricting process?
3993=                A.           I have become more aware through the county
3994=                redistricting process.
3995=                             In fact, at the county commission meeting,
3996=                open meeting that I referred to when the vote was being
3997=                taken, during the public portion of that, I asked the
3998=                question about did the commissioners feel and could they
3999=                agree that the minority-majority rule had been observed,
4000=                especially with regard to some changes in and around
4001=                Humboldt, Tennessee.
4002=                Q.           So you became aware of the majority-minority
fmt=pb
4003=                rule through your work?
4004=                A.           Yes.
4005=                Q.           Nonetheless, do you hold yourself out as an
4006=                expert on those factors?
4007=                A.           No.  No.
4008=                Q.           Are you an expert on the target population
4009=                for house districts in the 2022 redistricting?
4010=                A.           No.
4011=                Q.           Have you retained an expert to present
4012=                testimony in this lawsuit?
4013=                A.           Our team has an expert, yes.
4014=                Q.           And do you defer to him about opinions on
4015=                what county splits were necessary in order to comply with
4016=                the U.S. Constitution or Federal law?
4017=                A.           Yes.
4018=                Q.           You were asked some questions about your
4019=                legal claim in the complaint.  The claim that you filed in
4020=                the complaint in this case challenged -- did it challenge
4021=                the constitutionality of the enacted map, or did it
4022=                challenge the single act of splitting Gibson County?
4023=                A.           It challenged the constitutional aspect.
4024=                Q.           So as you sit here today, are you here to
4025=                urge the Court to undo one act of line drawing in Gibson
4026=                County, or is it bigger than that?
4027=                A.           I believe that the map for the State needs to
fmt=pb
4028=                be redistricted, redrawn.
4029=                             And I further would assert and ask the Court
4030=                to assure that it be done in an open and interpretive
4031=                process that allows for comment and input from the voters.
4032=                Q.           You testified earlier about a puzzle.
4033=                             Is it possible to just change one line that
4034=                was drawn on the map?
4035=                A.           Yeah.
4036=                             If only that could be true.  No.  Each piece
4037=                of the puzzle changes the entire puzzle to a degree.
4038=                Q.           You were asked some questions by the State
4039=                about your access and familiarity with your current
4040=                representative.
4041=                             Is he from -- I think you testified he's not
4042=                from Gibson County; correct?
4043=                A.           Our current representative, no.
4044=                Q.           Is he from the county next door?
4045=                A.           He is.  He's about a county over; right?
4046=                             And I add, he's a nice guy.  But,
4047=                politically, we're quite different.  I can say that.
4048=                Q.           Is he from an adjacent county, or one that's
4049=                separated from Gibson County?
4050=                A.           I believe he's adjacent.
4051=                Q.           And if the Gibson County commission or
4052=                leadership wants to get a road built that requires some
fmt=pb
4053=                involvement from the State, who do they need to contact?
4054=                A.           From Gibson County?
4055=                Q.           Yes.
4056=                A.           All right.  Well, we would need to make sure
4057=                we're addressing the representative from both District 82
4058=                and District 79.
4059=                Q.           So that's two representatives?
4060=                A.           Correct.
4061=                Q.           If they want to get state funds, if they need
4062=                to apply for state funds?
4063=                A.           Indeed.  If we're -- if we're trying to
4064=                pursue a county-wide issue or of interest to our specific
4065=                county, yes.
4066=                Q.           If they want to stop a landfill permit that's
4067=                right there in the middle of the county, who would they
4068=                contact?
4069=                A.           Yes.
4070=                Q.           Both representatives?
4071=                A.           Yes.
4072=                Q.           You were asked some questions about it being
4073=                your preference not to split Gibson County.  Do you
4074=                remember those questions?
4075=                A.           Yes.
4076=                Q.           Do you recall if the drafters of the
4077=                constitution expressed a preference about if counties
fmt=pb
4078=                should be split?
4079=                A.           The Tennessee Constitution?
4080=                Q.           Yes, sir.
4081=                A.           My understanding is that it asks or requires
4082=                that counties not be split.
4083=                Q.           Is it just your preference Gibson County not
4084=                be split?
4085=                A.           Well, the Constitution says it shouldn't, but
4086=                it's also my preference -- personal preference.
4087=                                   MR. SPRAGENS:  Thank you.  I don't have
4088=                any further questions at this time.
4089=                                   MS. HOLLARS:  Pass the witness.
4090=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
4091=                                   We'll take a lunch break and come back
4092=                at 1:15 -- I mean, 2:15.  I'm sorry.
4093=                                   (Recess taken from 1:10 p.m.
4094=                                    to 2:20 p.m.)
4095=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Next witness.
4096=                                   MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, Plaintiffs would
4097=                call Doug Himes.
4098=                                   And, Alex, do you want to let the Court
4099=                know how we're going to handle this?
4100=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Certainly.
4101=                                   So I believe that Plaintiffs intend to
4102=                call Mr. Himes as a hostile witness.
fmt=pb
4103=                                   I would be, technically, entitled to
4104=                lead him on my cross.  But it would be difficult because
4105=                the leading questions would be limited in scope -- maybe
4106=                limited in scope under Rule 611, to what they ask on
4107=                direct.
4108=                                   So rather than try to divide it up into
4109=                what can be leading cross-examination, what would be a
4110=                more traditional direct, we are going to -- we've agreed
4111=                with -- Plaintiffs and Defendants have agreed that we are
4112=                going to recall Mr. Himes.  So there will be no
4113=                cross-examination now.  We'll, during our proof, call him
4114=                and do his direct examination without leading questions in
4115=                the traditional manner.
4116=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.  Thank you.  I
4117=                appreciate that.
4118=       
4119=                                       DOUG HIMES,
4120=                was called as a witness, and having been duly sworn, was
4121=                examined and testified as follows:
4122=       
4123=                                   DIRECT EXAMINATION
4124=                BY MR. TIFT:
4125=                Q.           Good afternoon, Mr. Himes.  Could you take a
4126=                second just to introduce yourself to the Court.
4127=                A.           Sure.  I'm Doug Himes.  I'm the House Ethics
fmt=pb
4128=                Counsel for the Tennessee House of Representatives.
4129=                Q.           Okay.  And my first question was going to be,
4130=                what is your current job?  You've just described it as the
4131=                House Ethics Counsel; is that correct?
4132=                A.           That's correct.
4133=                Q.           Do you have any other current jobs at this
4134=                point?
4135=                A.           I have roles within that job.  And I was
4136=                serving as counsel to that house committee on
4137=                redistricting.
4138=                Q.           And what is your -- generally speaking, your
4139=                job responsibilities as ethics counsel to the House?
4140=                A.           So it's ethics counsel.  I serve as the staff
4141=                attorney for the House Ethics Committee.  I also serve,
4142=                hopefully, as a resource to members and staff of the House
4143=                on ethics, campaign finance, statement-of-interest
4144=                matters.
4145=                             I'm the liaison with the Bureau of Ethics and
4146=                Campaign Finance.  I work some with the Secretary of
4147=                State's Office, the Division of Elections, and with the
4148=                Attorney General's office from time to time on different
4149=                matters that may pertain to ethics and campaign finance.
4150=                             I also serve -- in that role, I'm,
4151=                technically, assigned to the Chief of the Clerk House
4152=                Office.  So I work with the Clerk as the counsel for the
fmt=pb
4153=                House Clerk, when it comes to rules and parliamentary
4154=                issues.
4155=                Q.           Okay.  And who is, technically, your employer
4156=                in that job?
4157=                A.           I guess, technically, it is the -- the House
4158=                of Representatives, we have a Speaker of the House.
4159=                Q.           And I'm aware that you've had a job with the
4160=                State for a good while.  Can you walk us through, just
4161=                sort of title-wise, what jobs you've held with the State
4162=                over the years.
4163=                A.           Sure.
4164=                             Starting in 1992, I served as an intern to
4165=                the Tennessee General Assembly.  I was assigned to
4166=                then-State Senator Stephen Cohen from Memphis.  It was
4167=                that senate state local government committee.
4168=                             After that, I went to graduate school, came
4169=                back and worked in the Office of Legal Services as a
4170=                session employee, a nonlawyer drafting resolutions and
4171=                proclamations honoring different people, mostly.
4172=                             After law school, I was hired at the end of
4173=                my law school with the Tennessee Attorney General's
4174=                Office, and I worked in the criminal justice division
4175=                about a year, year and a half.
4176=                             And then I went back to the General Assembly,
4177=                and I worked in the Office of Legal Services, which is a
fmt=pb
4178=                nonpartisan joint office that writes bills, staffs
4179=                committees and resolutions.  And I was there until 2018.
4180=                             And I left to work with the Bureau of Ethics
4181=                and Campaign Finance as the assistant director under Drew
4182=                Rawlins.  And about 11 months later, I was invited to come
4183=                back to the House in the current role that I have as House
4184=                Ethics Counsel.
4185=                Q.           And so, currently, your job for the General
4186=                Assembly is your primary source of income; correct?
4187=                A.           That's correct.
4188=                Q.           Okay.  And during the 2021-2022 redistricting
4189=                process, you served as the primary mapmaker for the House
4190=                of Representatives; correct?
4191=                A.           That's correct.
4192=                Q.           And you were not involved in drawing the
4193=                senate map in the 2021-2022 cycle; correct?
4194=                A.           I was not involved.
4195=                Q.           Okay.  And I want to walk through, generally,
4196=                the timeline of the 2021-'22 house redistricting process.
4197=                             Can you let us know when your office received
4198=                the level of census data that you needed to start your
4199=                process?
4200=                A.           So are you talking about the state level
4201=                redistricting data, that you can actually start crafting?
4202=                Q.           Yes.  Because I recall you received a few
fmt=pb
4203=                things before that but that you were waiting for something
4204=                before you could start.
4205=                A.           It was in August of '21.
4206=                Q.           Okay.  And upon receiving that data and
4207=                before the first meeting of the House Select Committee on
4208=                redistricting, you created a sort of first-draft map;
4209=                correct?
4210=                A.           Yes.  Worked on the concept from the date --
4211=                well, not exactly when we received it.  But when we
4212=                received it, the data that was put into a system called
4213=                Maptitude.  And once it gets into that system, it's a
4214=                little bit easier to work with in creating a concept for
4215=                redistricting.
4216=                             So sometime after that, which is probably
4217=                about a few days after the release to the public and to
4218=                the State of Tennessee, would have worked on a concept
4219=                from that point forward.
4220=                Q.           Okay.  And I was going to say, the language
4221=                that you'd used before was concept maps.  So just to go
4222=                back through that.
4223=                             Once the data was usable to you in your
4224=                Maptitude software, you put together a first concept map,
4225=                and you put that together before the first meeting of the
4226=                House Select Committee on redistricting; correct?
4227=                A.           It was a concept, yes.  And it was, roughly,
fmt=pb
4228=                from when it's workable to when that meeting was in
4229=                September of '21.
4230=                Q.           Right.
4231=                             By the time you got to that September 2021
4232=                meeting, you did have the concept prepared?
4233=                A.           Yes, there was a concept.
4234=                Q.           And then you presented a near final version
4235=                of what became the enacted house map at the December 17th,
4236=                2021, House Select Committee on redistricting; correct?
4237=                A.           That's correct.
4238=                Q.           And during those few months, between the
4239=                concept and the near final version in December, you
4240=                revised the map or parts of the map to get from that
4241=                concept to the near final version; correct?
4242=                A.           Yes.  It was continuously worked on from the
4243=                beginning inception until it passed.
4244=                Q.           And if we were to go to your Maptitude
4245=                account today, you would still have multiple different
4246=                drafts or iterations or subdrafts from that drafting
4247=                process still saved on your computer; correct?
4248=                A.           I wouldn't have -- there would be some.  But
4249=                the way that I will work with a concept is once there is a
4250=                concept, then meeting with the area coordinators for
4251=                redistricting, and then meeting with the 99 House members.
4252=                             Typically, I would just work it through and
fmt=pb
4253=                use that base as the concept.  Wouldn't have different --
4254=                wouldn't have, like, 100 different saved versions.  There
4255=                might be a few at different snapshots in time.
4256=                Q.           Sure.
4257=                             And I said nothing about 100.  But at your
4258=                deposition -- I'm just confirming -- you testified that
4259=                there would be drafts or subdrafts reflecting that
4260=                drafting process on your Maptitude still to today?
4261=                A.           Yes.  Everything that was on Maptitude then
4262=                is there now.
4263=                Q.           Okay.  Let's look at the enacted house map
4264=                itself.  It's in one of these four binders as Exhibit 29.
4265=                So the binders are labeled for their ranges.  So we're
4266=                looking for the range that includes 29.
4267=                             Some flipping probably to do.  We're looking
4268=                for Tab 29.  Once you get there, if we're all looking at
4269=                the same thing, it should say, on the top of it:
4270=                Chapter 598.
4271=                             Is that what you've got there, Mr. Himes?
4272=                A.           That's what it says.
4273=                Q.           All right.  Can you let us know what
4274=                Chapter 598 means in your understanding here?
4275=                A.           It's the public chapter number for the bill
4276=                that became law.
4277=                                   MR. TIFT:  Okay.  And I'd like to go
fmt=pb
4278=                ahead and admit this Exhibit 29 -- which we understand has
4279=                no objection -- as an exhibit.
4280=                                   MR. RIEGER:  No objection.
4281=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibit 29 is admitted,
4282=                without objection.
4283=                                   (Marked Exhibit 29.)
4284=                BY MR. TIFT:
4285=                Q.           And I want to talk about some terminology
4286=                briefly.
4287=                             So you just said Public Chapter 598 was the
4288=                public chapter that enacted the -- this map that we're
4289=                looking at; correct?
4290=                A.           Can you repeat that?  I'm sorry.
4291=                Q.           Yeah.
4292=                             Just confirming, Public Chapter 598 was the
4293=                public chapter number for the enacted house map; correct?
4294=                A.           That's correct.
4295=                Q.           And it's accurate to also say that that map
4296=                is reflected now in statute at TCA 3-1-103; correct?
4297=                A.           That's correct.
4298=                Q.           Okay.  And you agree that the enacted house
4299=                map that we're looking at splits 30 counties?
4300=                             And what I mean by that is, there's 30 times
4301=                where a portion of one county is prepared with one or more
4302=                other counties to form a district; correct?
fmt=pb
4303=                A.           There are 30 splits in Chapter 598.  I
4304=                don't -- I can't say that I can see what some of these
4305=                districts are because they're the same color.  But I'm
4306=                assuming it's the plan.
4307=                Q.           And you're quite familiar with the enacted
4308=                house map; correct?
4309=                A.           I am.
4310=                Q.           And you know, regardless of how the picture
4311=                looks, that the enacted house map has 30 county splits in
4312=                it; correct?
4313=                A.           The enacted -- Chapter 598 has 30 county
4314=                splits.
4315=                Q.           Okay.  And I keep using a shorthand we've
4316=                used often throughout this.  I keep saying "enacted house
4317=                map."  And can we agree that when I say that, I'm
4318=                referring to Public Chapter 598 and/or, now, TCA 3-1-103?
4319=                A.           Yes.
4320=                Q.           Okay.  I'm going to ask you a couple
4321=                questions that I fully expect are objected to for
4322=                privilege.  I'm saying that because I don't want to seem
4323=                like I'm tricking you into trying to answer.  Okay?  So
4324=                don't jump in with an answer.
4325=                             But during your months of drafting for the
4326=                2021-2022 redistricting cycle, did you ever try to create
4327=                a house map with fewer than 30 county-splitting districts?
fmt=pb
4328=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Objection, to the extent
4329=                that calls for attorney-client privilege or work-client
4330=                privilege.  The Court has already ruled on that in the
4331=                order governing the motion to compel.
4332=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  All right.
4333=                                   MR. TIFT:  And we agree with that being
4334=                the ruling.  And we'll need to establish the record on
4335=                some of these questions.
4336=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  We'll just stand by our
4337=                prior ruling.
4338=                                   Go ahead.
4339=                BY MR. TIFT:
4340=                Q.           And so during these months of drafting, did
4341=                you ever actually create any house maps with fewer than 30
4342=                county-splitting districts?
4343=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Objection, to the extent
4344=                that it goes into attorney-client privilege or
4345=                work-product privilege.  That has already been covered by
4346=                this Court's order on the motion to compel.
4347=                                   MR. TIFT:  And to avoid belaboring with
4348=                more questions, do we correctly understand that the State
4349=                takes the position that all of the private nonpublic
4350=                drafting process that Mr. Himes did is subject to the
4351=                privilege?
4352=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Yes.
fmt=pb
4353=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.  So noted for
4354=                the record.
4355=                                   MR. TIFT:  And I guess I would also
4356=                say, confirm you're instructing the witness not to answer
4357=                based on the privileges; correct?
4358=                                   MR. RIEGER:  I am.
4359=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
4360=                BY MR. TIFT:
4361=                Q.           All right.  Looking at the enacted house map,
4362=                do you agree that it has a total population variance of
4363=                9.90 percent; correct?
4364=                A.           That's correct.  It's 9.90.
4365=                Q.           And can you explain for us what a total
4366=                population variance means?
4367=                A.           Overall variance or total variance is going
4368=                to be your highest and lowest in deviation.  What district
4369=                is the lowest percentage from the ideal, which was 69,806
4370=                was the ideal for a house district.  And then, also, the
4371=                highest-populated districts.  Expressed as a percentage,
4372=                added together, gets you the 9.90.
4373=                             On the high end, was 5.09.  Those were
4374=                districts in Montgomery County.  It was kept whole, and
4375=                there were three districts.  On the low end, there were
4376=                two districts that composed the areas of Dickson,
4377=                Cheatham, Hickman, and Lewis, and those were both the
fmt=pb
4378=                negative 4.81.  Added together is the overall deviation of
4379=                9.90 percent.
4380=                Q.           Okay.  And so you agree that the metric of
4381=                total deviation doesn't reflect the population variance of
4382=                the other -- I guess, in this case, 96 or -7 districts;
4383=                correct?
4384=                A.           If you would repeat that.  Sorry.
4385=                Q.           Yes.
4386=                             You agree total population is reflecting the
4387=                top variance and the bottom variance and really doesn't
4388=                tell you anything about the other districts in between
4389=                population-wise, except that they're within that range?
4390=                A.           I would agree that the 9.90 is the expression
4391=                of the top, the bottom, everything else falls in between
4392=                that.
4393=                Q.           Okay.  And you don't have to say this.  But
4394=                can you walk us through both what the ideal population for
4395=                a district was under this map and what that means?
4396=                A.           Sure.
4397=                             So I mentioned the ideal population for the
4398=                map is -- for each house district is 69,806.  And,
4399=                essentially, that's taking the State's population -- which
4400=                I'm sure is in here somewhere, and I don't know it off the
4401=                top of my head -- based on the 2020 census, and dividing
4402=                it by 99, and that gets you to the 69,806.
fmt=pb
4403=                BY MR. TIFT:
4404=                Q.           And just to link that up, as you said -- if
4405=                you could turn -- it's going to be a different binder,
4406=                unfortunately.  You're going to be turning to Exhibit 99.
4407=                             Do you recognize this presentation that you
4408=                put together?
4409=                A.           Yes.
4410=                                   MR. TIFT:  Okay.  And at your
4411=                deposition, you testified this was a presentation you
4412=                presented to the House Select Committee on redistricting
4413=                on September 8th, 2021.
4414=                                   And we'd move that this go ahead and be
4415=                admitted as an exhibit.  And the parties had agreed
4416=                there's no objection.
4417=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  What exhibit number?
4418=                                   MR. TIFT:  This is 99.
4419=                                   MR. RIEGER:  No objection.
4420=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibit 99 is admitted,
4421=                without objection.
4422=                                   (Marked Exhibit 99.)
4423=                BY MR. TIFT:
4424=                Q.           If you turn -- the pages aren't numbered.
4425=                But if you turn to, approximately, the 13th.  I think it's
4426=                going to give us the data that -- numbers-wise that you
4427=                were referring to, so we can close up the question of how
fmt=pb
4428=                we got to the ideal population.
4429=                             So you found that page that has our aggregate
4430=                population numbers?
4431=                A.           Are you looking -- there's two pages that
4432=                have the information on it.  Are you looking at the
4433=                Tennessee growth through the decades or the 2020
4434=                population?
4435=                Q.           Right.
4436=                             I'm looking at the one that's general
4437=                redistricting population information, ideal population, TN
4438=                2020 population.
4439=                             Are we on the same page?
4440=                A.           Yes, we are.
4441=                Q.           Okay.  So could you walk the Court through
4442=                both -- using the actual numbers here, how we got to
4443=                the -- or how you get to the ideal population for a house
4444=                district.
4445=                A.           So this was part of the presentation.  It's
4446=                just the 2020 population of Tennessee, as reported by the
4447=                census.  The resident population of 6,910,840.  If you
4448=                divide that by 99, the end result is 69,806.
4449=                Q.           Okay.  And then in terms of earlier
4450=                discussing staying within a 10-percent range, does this
4451=                reflect your calculation of what would be 5 percent more
4452=                than average and 5 percent less than average?
fmt=pb
4453=                A.           So this reflects a standard 10-percent range,
4454=                which is not what the house used.  But it does reflect a
4455=                5-percent up and a 5-percent below.
4456=                             And as I mentioned, the House did a positive
4457=                5.09, and then on the low end did a negative 4.81.  So we
4458=                moved the range a little bit in order to keep the
4459=                accounting.
4460=                Q.           Okay.  And, again, that total deviation is
4461=                based on combining sort of the amount between the highest
4462=                populated and the least populated in those districts,
4463=                that's going to give you that percent; correct?
4464=                A.           That's correct.
4465=                Q.           Okay.  Again, fair warning.  A couple
4466=                questions that I expect to be objected to.
4467=                             During your drafting process, did you try to
4468=                make any maps with a total population variance lower than
4469=                9.90 percent?
4470=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Objection, to the extent
4471=                it goes into work-product or attorney-client privilege.
4472=                The Court's order on the motion to compel resolves that.
4473=                And I'll instruct the witness not to answer.
4474=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Agreed, in terms of our
4475=                prior ruling.  We're not going to change it now.
4476=                                   MR. TIFT:  Yes.
4477=                BY MR. TIFT:
fmt=pb
4478=                Q.           And then also during your drafting process,
4479=                did you, in fact, make any maps with a total population
4480=                variance lower than 9.90 percent?
4481=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Same objection, Your
4482=                Honor.
4483=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.  Noted for the
4484=                record.  Same comments by the counsel and by the panel.
4485=                                   MR. TIFT:  Thank you, Your Honor.
4486=                BY MR. TIFT:
4487=                Q.           Now, I'd like to talk about the
4488=                majority-minority districts in the enacted house map.
4489=                             You agree there are 13 majority-minority
4490=                districts in the house -- enacted house map; correct?
4491=                A.           That's correct.
4492=                Q.           You also agree that the enacted house map has
4493=                what you've referred to as two coalition districts;
4494=                correct?
4495=                A.           I think I typically use the term "opportunity
4496=                districts" to describe them.  There's two opportunity
4497=                districts in Davidson County.
4498=                Q.           Okay.  And you agree that when you presented
4499=                this map to various committees of the legislature that you
4500=                referred to them as coalition districts; correct?
4501=                A.           I won't dispute you because I don't recall.
4502=                I think of them mostly as opportunity districts, but I may
fmt=pb
4503=                have interchanged that terminology.
4504=                Q.           Okay.  And if the public transcript reflects
4505=                you saying "coalition," you're not saying you didn't say
4506=                "coalition district"?
4507=                A.           I wouldn't -- I don't disagree with that, no.
4508=                Q.           Okay.  So tell us what you mean by either a
4509=                coalition district or an opportunity district.
4510=                A.           Well -- so a coalition district or
4511=                opportunity district -- well, I guess I should backtrack a
4512=                little bit here because I think I've confused myself.
4513=                             A coalition district would be a district that
4514=                would have combined racial or ethnic, you know, voting age
4515=                population of 50 percent, plus one.
4516=                             An opportunity district, I think, would be
4517=                more of a district that has some high percentage of voting
4518=                age, Hispanic, African-American, Asian.  That's enough to
4519=                be -- to give sort of an influence or opportunity for a
4520=                racial minority act.
4521=                Q.           Okay.  And I'd now ask you to look to
4522=                Exhibit 95.  It's in the same binder that's in front of
4523=                you right now.  95.
4524=                             Okay.  And this Exhibit 95 is the transcript
4525=                of the select committee on redistricting's meeting from
4526=                December 17th, 2021.  I'm asking you to turn to Transcript
4527=                Page 28.
fmt=pb
4528=                             And you'll see that you start talking, at the
4529=                very start of Page 27, and continue into Page 28.  And at
4530=                28, Line 16, you say:  This concept creates two coalition
4531=                districts in Davidson County.
4532=                             Did I read that correctly?
4533=                A.           That's correct.
4534=                Q.           So I want to understand which one it is since
4535=                our -- we talked about terminology a minute ago.
4536=                             You agree that the enacted concept map has
4537=                two coalition districts; correct?
4538=                A.           Yes.  I misspoke and confused myself between
4539=                the two.
4540=                                   MR. TIFT:  Okay.  I'd move to admit 95,
4541=                and understand there's no objection to do so.
4542=                                   MR. RIEGER:  There is none.
4543=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibit 95 is admitted,
4544=                without objection.
4545=                                   (Marked Exhibit 95.)
4546=                BY MR. TIFT:
4547=                Q.           And when you were calculating what is or is
4548=                not a majority-minority district for the enacted house
4549=                map, what metric do you use to determine that?
4550=                             Tell me what a majority-minority district is
4551=                to you.  What does that mean?
4552=                A.           Okay.  So majority-minority district is
fmt=pb
4553=                50 percent, plus one voting age of the racial or ethnic
4554=                minority group in that district.
4555=                Q.           Okay.  And I understand that you have
4556=                testified that in your work for the House you consider
4557=                people who identify as only black in this instance, as
4558=                opposed to people who identify as all or part-black in
4559=                figuring out that percentage; is that correct?
4560=                A.           Yes.  I think what I described earlier, I
4561=                think in my depositions, was the House has traditionally
4562=                used the racial categories of black alone, Asian alone.
4563=                             And I think I went on to say that that does
4564=                not mean that using a -- any part-black or any part-Asian
4565=                is not the right way to do it.  But the metric that we've
4566=                used to look over time has always been a single-race
4567=                category.
4568=                Q.           Okay.  And you don't dispute that in, you
4569=                know, federal Voting Rights Act lawsuits, the Courts have
4570=                looked at all or part-black as well; correct?
4571=                A.           I agree that the Courts have looked at those
4572=                issues.
4573=                Q.           Okay.  Another couple questions, just
4574=                reserving -- recording in the trial record, that may have
4575=                an objection.
4576=                             During your drafting process, did you try to
4577=                make any maps of more than 13 majority-minority districts?
fmt=pb
4578=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Object, to the extent it
4579=                goes into attorney-client privilege or work product.  This
4580=                Court's order on the motion to compel resolves that.  I
4581=                would instruct the witness not to answer.

4584=                Q.           And second question, during the process, did
4585=                you, in fact, make any maps with more than 13
4586=                majority-minority districts?
4587=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Same objection.
4588=                                   And, also, I'll throw in relevance as
4589=                well, since there are no VRA claims in this case.
4590=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  So noted.
4591=                                   MR. TIFT:  Right.  And then I guess

4594=                rule on the relevance.
4595=                                   MR. TIFT:  Okay.
4596=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  He instructed him not to

4600=                BY MR. TIFT:
4601=                Q.           All right.  Now, if we can look -- you need

4657=                September 8th, 2021, meeting of the House Select Committee
4658=                on redistricting.
4659=                             You took part in that meeting; correct?
4660=                A.           That's correct.
4661=                                   MR. TIFT:  I'd move to admit Exhibit
4662=                94, which I understand is without objection.
4663=                                   MR. RIEGER:  No objection.
4664=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Admitted, without
4665=                objection.
4666=                                   (Marked Exhibit 94.)
4667=                BY MR. TIFT:
4668=                Q.           And let's turn to Page 15 of the transcript.
4669=                             All right.  We actually have to go back quite
4670=                a few pages for you to see that you're the one that's
4671=                talking.  This section begins on Page 6 of the transcript.
4672=                You'll see your name on Line 4.  And then feel free to
4673=                flip through.  It appears that you continue being the
4674=                speaker all the way through to Page 15.
4675=                             Do you recognize that?
4676=                A.           I do.
4677=                Q.           Okay.  On Page 15, Line 2, you state -- and I
fmt=pb
4678=                read, let me know if I get this wrong:  No more than 30
4679=                counties may be split to attach to other counties or parts
4680=                of counties to form multicounty districts.  So Article 2,
4681=                Section 5 of the Tennessee Constitution tells us, "Hey,
4682=                House of Representatives, don't split any counties."  The
4683=                one-person, one-vote standard says, "Well, you've got to
4684=                have your districts substantially equal in population."
4685=                And those two things, they conflict.  One is federal.  One
4686=                is our State Constitution.  In 1983, this issue came up in
4687=                front of the State Supreme Court in the case Lockert v.
4688=                Crowell.  And the Supreme Court, in its wisdom, said, "All
4689=                right, House.  In order for you to comply with one-person,
4690=                one-vote, we know you're going to have to split counties.
4691=                But we're going to put that limit at 30.  You're not going
4692=                to split more than 30, and you're not going to split, at
4693=                the time, the four urban counties but for two reasons.  So
4694=                you're limited to 30.  The four urbans would count if you
4695=                would split them for these reasons."
4696=                             Did I read that correctly?
4697=                A.           Yes.
4698=                Q.           All right.  And you agree, during this
4699=                passage, you did not inform the members of the
4700=                subcommittee about their obligation to cross as few county
4701=                lines as necessary to comply with federal constitution
4702=                requirements; correct?
fmt=pb
4703=                A.           I agree.  I mean, what I said is what I said.
4704=                So . . .
4705=                Q.           Right.
4706=                             And you can't point me to anywhere in this
4707=                transcript, where you informed the committee that they
4708=                needed to attempt to divide as few counties as possible to
4709=                comply with federal constitution requirements; correct?
4710=                A.           I think what I've said is here.
4711=                Q.           Okay.  And then we'll go back -- we've
4712=                already looked at and admitted Exhibit 99.  That's the
4713=                written presentation that I assume was probably on the
4714=                screen or something that accompanied your remarks.  That's
4715=                Exhibit 99, if you'll turn back to it.
4716=                             And on the 16th page here -- again, I'm sorry
4717=                they're not numbered, but the original wasn't numbered.
4718=                             You put up the six house redistricting
4719=                guidelines that we had looked at in a separate exhibit
4720=                before.  It says:  House redistricting guidelines.
4721=                             And it has six bullets.
4722=                A.           Yes.
4723=                Q.           And the fifth bullet -- let me know if I read
4724=                it correctly -- says:  No more than 30 counties may be
4725=                split to attach to other counties or parts of counties to
4726=                form multicounty districts.
4727=                             Did I read that correctly?
fmt=pb
4728=                A.           That's correct.  And that's the language in
4729=                3-1-103.
4730=                Q.           Okay.  And -- yeah.  So that -- so this
4731=                language comes directly from the six enumerated factors in
4732=                TCA 3-1-103; correct?
4733=                A.           I believe it's pretty much verbatim.
4734=                Q.           And you agree that this fifth bullet does not
4735=                say that the General Assembly should divide counties only
4736=                as necessary to comply with federal and constitutional
4737=                requirements; correct?
4738=                A.           I would -- I think the bullet says no more
4739=                than 30 counties may be split to attach to other counties
4740=                or parts of counties for multicounty districts.
4741=                                   MR. TIFT:  Okay.  Let's turn now to
4742=                Exhibit 95.
4743=                                   Exhibit 95 is the transcript of the
4744=                December 17th, 2012 [sic], hearing of the House Select
4745=                Committee on redistricting.
4746=                                   I'm sorry to say my housekeeping is
4747=                already off here.  I think we may have already admitted
4748=                it.  But if not, I'd move to admit it without objection.
4749=                                   MR. RIEGER:  There's no objection, but
4750=                I think it was admitted.
4751=                                   MR. TIFT:  Okay.
4752=                BY MR. TIFT:
fmt=pb
4753=                Q.           And, Mr. Himes, you participated in this
4754=                meeting of the select committee; correct?
4755=                A.           I did.
4756=                Q.           I want to direct you to Page 46 of the
4757=                transcript.
4758=                             Have you found Page 46?
4759=                A.           I believe I have, yes.
4760=                Q.           Okay.  And starting at Line 21, these are
4761=                words stated by Representative Karen V. Camper.
4762=                             Do you see where I am?
4763=                A.           Yes.
4764=                Q.           And I believe we refer to Representative
4765=                Camper as Leader Camper; correct?
4766=                A.           That's correct.
4767=                Q.           Okay.  So Representative Camper states, on
4768=                Line 21, to you:  I think I understand what you're saying.
4769=                This map creates a situation where we have a 30-county
4770=                split.  Is that what you said in your presentation?  And
4771=                you also mentioned earlier, if I'm not mistaken, that the
4772=                Supreme Court decision felt it best to not split, if
4773=                possible.  If at all possible, the least amount making
4774=                sure that there's equal representation, that we would not
4775=                go to that 30-number limit.  But, in this case, we
4776=                actually did.  And so could you talk about the rationale
4777=                for, you know, 23-county split versus, like in our plan,
fmt=pb
4778=                it's 23.  And we still gave equal representation.  We met
4779=                within Lockert's decisions and all the things that the
4780=                Constitution requires.  Why would we go to the 30-county
4781=                split, if we could have did less than that?
4782=                             And then Representative Johnson recognizes
4783=                you.  And you respond:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Leader
4784=                Camper, I -- you know, Lockert gives you an upper limit of
4785=                30.  And it's something that -- since we have the Lockert
4786=                decision, it's something that we placed in the Tennessee
4787=                code as one of our criteria.  And it's consistently
4788=                adopted as one of our criteria that our limit is 30.
4789=                While it is true that you can sometimes draft plans with
4790=                fewer county splits, you have the discretion to get to
4791=                that limit, and that becomes a policy decision that
4792=                you-all -- that you make.  I -- to say -- I mean, I would
4793=                suggest that if you -- if you kept it in the plan that was
4794=                presented earlier, if you kept Shelby whole, you wouldn't
4795=                just split 23.  You would have more splits.  And I think
4796=                what Lockert says, keep the urban counties whole.  So 23
4797=                is -- I think is -- is a great number, but I don't know
4798=                that it's a number that you get to, but for splitting
4799=                Shelby County.
4800=                             Did I read that correctly?
4801=                A.           I think, essentially, yes.
4802=                Q.           Yeah.  I think I stumbled once or twice.
fmt=pb
4803=                             But you agree that, in this hearing, you, in
4804=                response to Leader Camper's question, you stated that --
4805=                whether or not to divide fewer than 30 counties is a
4806=                policy decision for the members to make; correct?
4807=                A.           I think, yes, I said -- I said while it is
4808=                true that you can sometimes draft plans with fewer county
4809=                splits, you have the discretion to get to that, to do
4810=                that, and that becomes a policy decision that you-all --
4811=                that you make.
4812=                Q.           Okay.  And you agree that you did not inform
4813=                Leader Camper or the rest of the body at this time that
4814=                Lockert required them to divide as few counties as
4815=                necessary to comply with federal constitutional
4816=                requirements; correct?
4817=                A.           That's not -- yeah.  That's not included
4818=                here.
4819=                Q.           And now let's turn to Exhibit 96.
4820=                             Exhibit 96 is the transcript of the hearing
4821=                of the January 18th, 2022, hearing of the house state
4822=                government committee.
4823=                             Have you found that tab?
4824=                A.           (Witness nods head.)
4825=                                   MR. TIFT:  I'd like to move, at this
4826=                point, to admit Exhibit 96.  My understanding is that it's
4827=                without objection.
fmt=pb
4828=                                   MR. RIEGER:  It is without objection.
4829=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Admitted, without
4830=                objection.
4831=                                   (Marked Exhibit 96.)
4832=                BY MR. TIFT:
4833=                Q.           And you recall participating in this
4834=                committee hearing as well; correct?
4835=                A.           I do.
4836=                Q.           And if we turn to Page 25 of the transcript.
4837=                On Page 25, the bottom part of the page -- on 25, at the
4838=                bottom of the page, Representative Bill Beck is speaking.
4839=                             And he states, starting at Line 23:  And were
4840=                there any -- there were other plans produced that split
4841=                less counties.  I believe 23 or 24.  Is there -- is there
4842=                a reason we didn't strive in this plan to split less
4843=                counties?
4844=                             Vice Chairman Aldridge recognizes you.  And
4845=                you respond:  Representative Beck, I think you know, under
4846=                the Lockert decision, the maximum that that Court, the
4847=                Tennessee Supreme Court, suggested that we split is 30.
4848=                And this plan does split 30.  And when you go east to --
4849=                we started in some ways going east.  We had some -- there
4850=                was population issues coming out of the northeast corner.
4851=                And you start splitting counties that you don't have any
4852=                choice but to split.  Could you split -- well, yeah,
fmt=pb
4853=                fewer?  Possibly.  And I think that becomes a policy
4854=                decision about those.  But you're always going to split
4855=                more counties.  Probably closer to 26, 25, 27, 28.  And
4856=                then we have the discretion to split counties, although we
4857=                try not to.  This one splits 30.
4858=                             You agree here that you, again, are stating
4859=                that it's a policy decision whether or not to split fewer
4860=                than 30 counties; correct?
4861=                A.           I think what I've said is there, yes.
4862=                Q.           Okay.  And you agree, in response to
4863=                Representative Beck's question, you did not inform him or
4864=                the body that Lockert requires the General Assembly to
4865=                divide counties only as necessary to comply with the
4866=                federal constitutional requirements; correct?
4867=                A.           What I've said is here.
4868=                Q.           Okay.  And you agree that's not what you said
4869=                there; correct?
4870=                A.           It's not said there.
4871=                Q.           Okay.  In all three of these hearings, based
4872=                on your memory of these hearings, you're not aware of any
4873=                point where you informed the bodies you were speaking to
4874=                of an obligation to divide as few counties as necessary to
4875=                comply with federal constitutional requirements; correct?
4876=                A.           I don't think it would have been those words.
4877=                Q.           Okay.  And you would agree that the words are
fmt=pb
4878=                recorded for any person to review, including the Court;
4879=                correct?
4880=                A.           In here, yes.
4881=                Q.           And so in the transcript sections that we've
4882=                reviewed, you agree that you did not inform the bodies of
4883=                an obligation to cross as few county lines as necessary to
4884=                comply with federal law; correct?
4885=                A.           What we reviewed, I informed them of the TCA
4886=                code provision, which is part of our guidelines.
4887=                Q.           And you don't have any memory from these
4888=                hearings of saying that the body actually had to divide
4889=                only as many as necessary to comply with federal law;
4890=                correct?
4891=                A.           I don't have a memory of saying exactly what
4892=                you're suggesting that I may or may not have said.
4893=                Q.           Okay.  And then when you were questioned
4894=                about dividing fewer than 30 on two separate hearings, you
4895=                informed the body that it was a policy decision, up to
4896=                their discretion, whether to divide fewer than 30;
4897=                correct?
4898=                A.           And that's based on the plans that were in
4899=                front of them at the time.
4900=                Q.           Okay.  And that wasn't my question.
4901=                             My question was, you agree that that's what
4902=                you informed them when they asked you if you should be
fmt=pb
4903=                dividing fewer?
4904=                A.           I agree that's what I said.  But that's the
4905=                context of those statements.
4906=                Q.           Okay.  And you're unable to testify today
4907=                about what you actually did as the map drawer; correct --
4908=                as we've heard from the objections?
4909=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Maintain the objection.
4910=                                   You can probably answer that with a
4911=                "yes" or "no," but you can't go further than that.
4912=                                   THE WITNESS:  So there's that concept
4913=                that was developed, and then that worked into the final
4914=                plan.
4915=                BY MR. TIFT:
4916=                Q.           Right.
4917=                             In all those concepts and drafting process,
4918=                you're not permitted to tell me about today here;
4919=                correct -- under the privilege that's been asserted?
4920=                A.           I guess you have the concept was -- you-all
4921=                have the original concept that made this plan.
4922=                Q.           You mean we have the -- what you describe as
4923=                the near final enacted plan that was debuted at the
4924=                December 2021 meeting of the House Select Committee;
4925=                correct?
4926=                             But we do not have Doug Himes's concept map
4927=                from September, the first map that you drew, that's been
fmt=pb
4928=                held back under the attorney-client privilege; correct --
4929=                and the work-product privilege?
4930=                A.           I don't know the answer to that.
4931=                                   MR. TIFT:  Okay.  And just to confirm
4932=                with Alex, any maps beyond those presented publicly have
4933=                been withheld due to a sustained privilege; correct?
4934=                                   MR. RIEGER:  That is correct.
4935=                                   MR. TIFT:  Okay.
4936=                BY MR. TIFT:
4937=                Q.           Now, let's . . .
4938=                             Do you recall, during the redistricting
4939=                process, through Representative Freeman, the house
4940=                democratic caucus presented a concept map.  And you worked
4941=                with -- you pointed out some issues to them, and they
4942=                presented a second version of it.  Do you recall that?
4943=                A.           I do.
4944=                Q.           Okay.  And I'd ask you to turn to page -- to
4945=                Tab 15.  We're going to have to switch binders now.  We're
4946=                jumping back to one of the first binders.  Tab 15.
4947=                             It's a fairly large document that I'm just
4948=                using for one page of it.  If you'll turn to the
4949=                next-to-last page.
4950=                             Well, first, I'll say, this was your
4951=                affidavit, which you signed at the early phase of this
4952=                litigation, March 22nd, 2022.  That's on Page 15, your
fmt=pb
4953=                signature.
4954=                             You remember creating and submitting this
4955=                affidavit; correct?
4956=                A.           I do.
4957=                Q.           And if we turn to the next-to-last page,
4958=                you'll agree that the next-to-last page, which is labeled
4959=                Himes 6, is your analysis of that democratic caucus house
4960=                concept presented by Representative Freeman; correct?
4961=                             We're looking at the next-to-last page, which
4962=                has an exhibit, Himes 6, on the top corner.  That's your
4963=                analysis of the revised democratic house caucus concept;
4964=                correct?
4965=                A.           Yes.  I think this would be the plan that was
4966=                offered on -- at the December meeting.
4967=                Q.           Okay.  And I'm just going to go through your
4968=                analysis.
4969=                             You agree that this proposal had a 9.72
4970=                overall deviation; correct?
4971=                A.           That's correct.
4972=                Q.           And this concept split 23 counties; correct?
4973=                A.           Yes, but.
4974=                Q.           Had 23 counties split.  So I know you've got
4975=                a "but."
4976=                             But it did split 23 counties; correct?
4977=                A.           Yes, but.
fmt=pb
4978=                Q.           Okay.  And we'll get back to -- I'll call
4979=                that an asterisk.
4980=                             You agree that this plan was contiguous,
4981=                that's what the "yes" means; correct?
4982=                A.           That's correct.
4983=                Q.           There were not any unassigned areas; correct?
4984=                A.           That's correct as well.
4985=                Q.           And your asterisk, which is in the form of a
4986=                Footnote 1, points out that one of the splits that is in
4987=                those 23 is a split involving Shelby County; correct?
4988=                A.           Oh, sorry.  The -- I was looking at the
4989=                incumbents.
4990=                             But, yes.  The asterisk with county splits,
4991=                yes.
4992=                Q.           Right.
4993=                             And that's the -- what you referred to as
4994=                your "but" just a second ago; right?
4995=                A.           Yes.
4996=                Q.           Okay.  So you would agree this map had 23
4997=                splits and that one of those splits is a split involving
4998=                Shelby County.
4999=                A.           That's correct.
5000=                                   MR. TIFT:  I'd like to admit that
5001=                Exhibit 15, which I understand is without objection.
5002=                                   MR. RIEGER:  No objection.
fmt=pb
5003=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  15 is admitted, without

5006=                BY MR. TIFT:
5007=                Q.           I'm going to ask you some questions about
5008=                your communications with General Assembly members.
5009=                             During the drafting process, you did
5010=                communicate with members of the House about redistricting;
5011=                correct?
5012=                A.           In general terms, yes.  I met with all 99 at
5013=                some point during the process.
5014=                Q.           Right.
5015=                             And, to be clear, I'm not currently asking
5016=                for the content of those, but their existence.
5017=                             And before you created your initial concept
5018=                map, you heard from some house members, and you worked to
5019=                incorporate their priorities into the concept map, if
5020=                possible; correct?
5021=                A.           Before the initial concept?
5022=                Q.           Right.
5023=                             Before you drafted your initial concept map
5024=                in, roughly, September, you had heard from some members
5025=                and you did your best, as possible, to incorporate their
5026=                priorities?
5027=                                   MR. RIEGER:  I'm going to object, just
fmt=pb
5028=                in case that treads on work product or attorney-client
5029=                privilege.
5030=                                   If there's a way to answer it without
5031=                going into it, please do.
5032=                                   THE WITNESS:  So, I guess, generally
5033=                speaking, would have received probably some direction, I
5034=                think, when the census information came out.  There was
5035=                the dramatic change in population.
5036=                                   So I would have had some direction.
5037=                And it would force, basically, a three-seat shift of the
5038=                house districts towards Middle Tennessee because of the
5039=                loss of population in the Upper Cumberland Plateau, West
5040=                Tennessee, primarily.
5041=                                   But it forced a shift of seats.  So I
5042=                would have received some direction on where those
5043=                contractions may occur, where the districts would no
5044=                longer be in their original areas, but move to Middle
5045=                Tennessee, where to move the seats from.
5046=                BY MR. TIFT:
5047=                Q.           Mr. Himes, your deposition transcript from
5048=                September of last year is included under Exhibit 4 in the
5049=                binders.  Can you take a look at that?
5050=                             So Tab 4.  It is your deposition from
5051=                September 9th, 2022.  I'd like to direct you to Page 44.
5052=                             Page 44 and Tab 4 is your deposition.  And
fmt=pb
5053=                the question at the bottom of the page, I ask:  In coming
5054=                up with what you call the concept map, which you said
5055=                happened at some point in September, to come up with that,
5056=                did you incorporate priorities from house leadership?
5057=                             And your answer was:  My sense is I would
5058=                have.  I would have had some direction, I believe, on
5059=                where the districts that needed to move to Tennessee would
5060=                be from.
5061=                             So you agree that you did incorporate input
5062=                from members in coming up with your concept map; correct?
5063=                A.           I think that's what I just said now.
5064=                Q.           Okay.  Great.
5065=                             So you incorporated feedback to make your
5066=                concept map from members?
5067=                A.           I said -- what I said here is I had a sense

5069=                that three-seat shift would have come from.  And I believe

5072=                Q.           And you also got direction from Speaker
5073=                Sexton staff; correct?
5074=                                   MR. RIEGER:  I believe, again -- again,

5079=                Q.           I'm not asking about content.  I'm asking you
5080=                to confirm your deposition testimony, that you received
5081=                input from Speaker Sexton's staff to inform your drafting
5082=                process.
5083=                A.           I believe that's what it says here, that in a

5088=                communicated with house members and tried to incorporate

5095=                Q.           But you did receive some e-mails from members
5096=                about redistricting; correct?
5097=                A.           I suspect I did.
5098=                Q.           Yes.
5099=                             Now, I'm going to ask you about content and
5100=                expect an objection that's already been sustained.
5101=                             But did you -- did any General Assembly

5171=                BY MR. TIFT:
5172=                Q.           Mr. Himes, you agree, in your opinion, if
5173=                you're -- you know, having done maps for the last few
5174=                decades in the State, you believe that the enacted house
5175=                map complies with the Voting Rights Act; correct?
5176=                A.           I believe it does.
5177=                Q.           And in your role as the mapmaker, do you have
fmt=pb
5178=                opinion about whether you could have created fewer county
5179=                divides and still had a constitutional map?
5180=                A.           I think -- as we've discussed earlier in the
5181=                deposition, I think it's theoretically possible.  That
5182=                doesn't preclude both or all from being constitutional.
5183=                                   MR. TIFT:  If I could take a brief
5184=                minute to consult.
5185=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Yes, sir.

5188=                call him in their affirmative case and will address all
5189=                questions to him at that time.
5190=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you, sir.
5191=                                   MR. RIEGER:  Mr. Himes, the rule is
5192=                still in effect.  So we'll need you to leave, please, and
5193=                we'll let you know when we recall you tomorrow.  Thank

fmt=pb
5203=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, we would
5204=                object to calling Mr. Cervas on the same grounds as
5205=                covered in our motion in limine and our motion to
5206=                disqualify.  We realize the Court's ruling on it.  We just
5207=                wanted to preserve the objection.
5208=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Duly noted.  Thank you.
5209=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Thank you, Your Honor.

5211=                                   MR. TIFT:  And before Dr. Cervas starts
5212=                testifying, I thought we could go ahead and put on the
5213=                record admitting the five documents that he created.  I
5214=                can go through them one at a time.
5215=                                   Exhibit 7 is his October 10th, 2022,

5219=                                   Subject to the objection.  I apologize,

5274=                Q.           Dr. Cervas, I want to go through your
5275=                educational background.  And to assist everyone listening,
5276=                and perhaps yourself as well, your CV has been submitted,
5277=                attached to several of your reports, but among others,
fmt=pb
5278=                Exhibit 7 is your report on the senate.  And the back side
5279=                of it, the last few pages of it, includes your curriculum
5280=                vitae.
5281=                             So once you're there, could you walk us
5282=                through your educational background.
5283=                A.           Sure.
5284=                             I received my bachelor's degree in political
5285=                science from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in 2007.
5286=                             I went to the graduate school at the
5287=                University of California Irvine, where I earned my
5288=                master's degree and my PhD.  The PhD, I received in
5289=                2020 -- August of 2020.
5290=                Q.           All right.  And I would ask you to go through
5291=                your current employment -- both your current employment --
5292=                well, your current employer first.  Sorry.
5293=                A.           I'm currently employed at Carnegie Mellon
5294=                University in Pittsburgh, as I mentioned.  There, I'm a
5295=                post-doctoral fellow, where I teach classes in the
5296=                institute of politics and strategy.  And currently
5297=                teaching two classes, including one that I had to postpone
5298=                for tomorrow to be here.
5299=                Q.           All right.  And then I understand that you
5300=                have been involved in several different redistricting
5301=                matters in recent years.  I was wondering if you could
5302=                walk through these one at a time.  First, I'd like to
fmt=pb
5303=                understand your role related to the recent redistricting
5304=                in New York State.
5305=                A.           Sure.
5306=                             I was appointed as -- by the New York Supreme
5307=                Court as special master.  The Court appointed me to --
5308=                originally, contingent to the final outcome of the case,
5309=                to draw remedial statewide maps for both the U.S.
5310=                congressional districts in New York and the state senate
5311=                districts in New York.
5312=                             The Court of Appeals subsequently upheld the
5313=                lower court's ruling and changed my role from contingent
5314=                to being the person who actually was in charge of drawing
5315=                those maps.  And, eventually, come late May of 2022, I
5316=                delivered those maps, and they were in use for the 2022
5317=                elections, both the congressional maps and the state
5318=                senate maps.
5319=                Q.           And, to be clear, who did you work for in
5320=                that role?
5321=                A.           I was appointed by the New York Supreme Court
5322=                under the supervision of the justice of that Court.
5323=                Q.           And working as special master in that case,
5324=                I'm not sure you said which statewide maps you were
5325=                working on.
5326=                A.           Oh, I did.  I'll repeat and say that it was
5327=                the U.S. congressional -- 26-district U.S. congressional
fmt=pb
5328=                map, and also the state senate map, which consists of 63
5329=                districts statewide.
5330=                Q.           Okay.  And did you have any people, employees
5331=                assisting you in that role?
5332=                A.           I did.  I asked the Court if it would be okay
5333=                if I had a small staff to help me with the task because
5334=                redistricting can be quite complex.
5335=                             And I had my mentor, who is my PhD advisor,
5336=                Bernard Grofman, was on my team.  I also hired one of his
5337=                undergraduate students, Zach Griggy, who has worked with
5338=                me in other capacities and has worked with Dr. Grofman in
5339=                his capacity as special master on other engagements.
5340=                             Additionally, I had on my staff somebody who
5341=                was about to graduate from New York Law School.  She
5342=                actually graduated law school while we were in the middle
5343=                of our project.  And I had a friend of mine who I've
5344=                worked with in other capacities on redistricting who is
5345=                from the state of New York, with knowledge of their
5346=                communities of interest, Jason Fearman, who also assisted.
5347=                             So it was the team of the five of us who
5348=                worked on that project.
5349=                Q.           Okay.  And among your staff, who bore the
5350=                ultimate responsibility for each of the maps submitted to
5351=                the Court?
5352=                A.           I was appointed special master, and,
fmt=pb
5353=                therefore, it was my job to both deliver the maps, and
5354=                responsible for ensuring that it complied with all state
5355=                and federal law.
5356=                             Now, ultimately, the buck stopped with me.  I
5357=                was in charge of the maps.
5358=                Q.           And did you recommend or submit any maps to
5359=                the Court that you had not reviewed and approved?
5360=                A.           No.  I approved -- I delivered the map
5361=                personally after I approved it.  And, of course, helped to
5362=                draw these maps, together with my team.
5363=                Q.           Next, I would like to understand what role
5364=                you had in the state of Pennsylvania recently.
5365=                A.           So this is -- depending on how you define
5366=                things, I'm still sort of technically appointed to that
5367=                position.  The commission has now ended.  We are writing a
5368=                final report.
5369=                             In that role, the title I was given was
5370=                redistricting consultant.  And this is a political
5371=                commission made up of the -- both the chambers of the
5372=                state legislature, the House and the Senate, the majority
5373=                and the minority leaders.  So there are the four leaders
5374=                of the state legislature, and one mutual chair, which was
5375=                appointed by the State Supreme Court.
5376=                             I was hired as the commission's redistricting
5377=                consultant and mapmaker.  And so in that role, I helped to
fmt=pb
5378=                devise the two plans that became law and are currently
5379=                used and were used in the 2022 election, for both the
5380=                State House of Representatives and the State Senate.
5381=                Q.           Okay.  And you said those maps are currently
5382=                in place and active in Pennsylvania?
5383=                A.           That's right.
5384=                Q.           All right.  Did you have any assistance in
5385=                that role?  Or any people working as an assistant to you?
5386=                A.           Nobody worked for me in that role.  I was
5387=                working for the commission, as their -- almost as if I was
5388=                their assistant.
5389=                Q.           And so am I correct, between those two jobs,
5390=                you were the primary mapmaker responsible for four
5391=                different statewide maps?
5392=                A.           That's right.
5393=                Q.           Can you list for us what those four maps are?
5394=                A.           So in Pennsylvania, I -- the responsibility
5395=                of the commission was the State House of Representatives
5396=                203-district map, the Pennsylvania State Senate Map with
5397=                its 50 districts.
5398=                             In New York, I was in charge of the State
5399=                Senate map, with 63 districts, and the U.S. congressional
5400=                districts, 26 districts.
5401=                Q.           And I understand you've worked three other
5402=                occasions as the assistant to a special master.  Can you
fmt=pb
5403=                tell the Court about those engagements?
5404=                A.           Yes.
5405=                             There were federal court cases decided over
5406=                the last, I guess now, six years, in which my mentor,
5407=                Bernard Grofman -- Dr. Bernard Grofman, was appointed as
5408=                special master by the federal courts.  And in those -- in
5409=                his roles there, he hired me as his assistant because he
5410=                doesn't have the -- he did not have, at the time, the
5411=                technical skills to run the software.  And so, together,
5412=                we worked on those maps, the remedial maps.
5413=                Q.           Which states did those involve?
5414=                A.           So the very first case was out of Utah.  The
5415=                second case was in Virginia, and the third case was out of
5416=                Georgia.
5417=                Q.           And were those all statewide, or were some of
5418=                them subsets of a state or other political subdivisions?
5419=                A.           Those were all subsets of states.
5420=                Q.           And do you recall what subsets they were of
5421=                the states?
5422=                A.           Yes.
5423=                             Well, in Utah, it was a court case titled
5424=                Navajo Nation.  And it was centered around San Juan
5425=                County, Utah.  So it was a county redistricting case.
5426=                             In Virginia, it was -- this was technically a
5427=                statewide case.  This was a case that went to the U.S.
fmt=pb
5428=                Supreme Court.  Bethune-Hill.  And there the district
5429=                court ruled that 11 of the house of delegate districts had
5430=                been -- resulted from racial gerrymandering, and they
5431=                required a redraw of the house of delegates map.
5432=                             It's a 100-district map, but we only redrew
5433=                25 of them in order to narrowly tailor our remedial to the
5434=                effective districts.
5435=                Q.           Okay.  So that was --
5436=                A.           And in Georgia, it was a subset.  It was a
5437=                county.  Again, a county redistricting school board.  It
5438=                was Sumter County, Georgia.  Better known as the home of
5439=                Jimmy Carter.
5440=                Q.           So do I understand correctly that you've
5441=                worked on -- in five different states as special master,
5442=                assistant to the special master, or in Pennsylvania for
5443=                the legislative commission on redistricting?
5444=                A.           Yes, that's right.
5445=                Q.           And in the three roles where you were
5446=                assistant to Special Master Grofman, do I understand
5447=                correctly that you were the one running the mapmaking
5448=                software to do the actual line drawing, in consultation
5449=                with Dr. Grofman?
5450=                A.           Yes.  In all three cases, I was the -- you
5451=                might call me the primary mapmaker, as used before, those
5452=                words.  But, yes, I ran the software.
fmt=pb
5453=                Q.           Okay.  And now looking to that CV that's, I
5454=                believe, still in front of you.
5455=                             Have you written peer-reviewed articles in
5456=                recent years?
5457=                A.           In whatever time I have available to me, I
5458=                try to work on research.
5459=                Q.           All right.
5460=                A.           It would have been updated from this point,
5461=                but not very much.
5462=                Q.           Okay.  And Page 1 and 2 lists publications.
5463=                And I'd like to go through those publications briefly to
5464=                understand which ones touched on redistricting.  And as
5465=                far as I'm concerned, you're welcome to use the numbers,
5466=                as opposed to reading the whole names of them.  But
5467=                however you'd like to.
5468=                             Just tell us which ones of these had a --
5469=                touched on redistricting.
5470=                A.           Okay.
5471=                             So Number 2, Number 4, Number 5, Number 6.
5472=                I'm going to say Number 7.  It's very tangential, but it
5473=                does.  Number 10.  And, very slightly, Number 11.
5474=                Q.           Okay.  So you listed one, two, three, four,
5475=                five of these publications as being about redistricting,
5476=                and another two being tangentially touching redistricting;
5477=                correct?
fmt=pb
5478=                A.           (Witness nods head.)
5479=                Q.           And we won't go through the list.  But have
5480=                you had other in-progress work that touched on
5481=                redistricting?
5482=                A.           I have a paper forthcoming at the New
5483=                Hampshire Law Review, which is about state level -- state
5484=                courts' effect on partisan gerrymandering.
5485=                Q.           Have you -- in your teaching capacity, has
5486=                any of your teaching touched on redistricting?
5487=                A.           I teach a class in the semester, which is
5488=                this current semester, called Representation and Voting
5489=                Rights.  And we do about six weeks on redistricting.
5490=                                   MR. TIFT:  All right.  At this time,
5491=                I'd like to move to admit Dr. Cervas as a testifying
5492=                expert, such that under the 700 series of the Rules of
5493=                Evidence, he's allowed to give opinion testimony
5494=                concerning redistricting.
5495=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, we would
5496=                object on the same grounds, for our motion to exclude and
5497=                the motion in limine.  We understand the Court has ruled
5498=                on those.
5499=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  The Court determines that
5500=                Dr. Cervas is, indeed, an expert in the matters of writing
5501=                maps and other issues related to redistricting, as per his
5502=                testimony and his curriculum vitae.  And so he will be
fmt=pb
5503=                allowed to testify as an expert.
5504=                BY MR. TIFT:
5505=                Q.           All right.  Dr. Cervas, as you know, as
5506=                everyone knows here, we have a claim related to the
5507=                Senate, a claim related to the House.  I'd like to talk
5508=                about the claim related to the Senate first.
5509=                             And Exhibit 7, which is the one I believe
5510=                you're already looking at, is your sole report on the
5511=                senate claim.  Do you still have that in front of you?
5512=                A.           Yes.
5513=                Q.           Okay.  I just want to start off by asking,
5514=                you know, what were you asked to do concerning the enacted
5515=                senate map?
5516=                A.           I was asked to evaluate the enacted 2022 map
5517=                as to whether the districts that were inside of a county
5518=                that had multiple districts were sequentially numbered.
5519=                And then if there was a violation of that constitutional
5520=                provision, to provide an alternative plan which would
5521=                remedy that problem.
5522=                Q.           And did you determine whether the four
5523=                Davidson County senate districts were, in fact, not
5524=                numbered consecutively?
5525=                A.           That's right.  They include District 17, 19,
5526=                20, and 21.  And so, therefore, they are nonsequential.
5527=                Q.           And have you reached an expert opinion and
fmt=pb
5528=                conclusion about whether or not Davidson County's four
5529=                senate districts could have been consecutively numbered?
5530=                A.           I have.  I have created an alternative plan
5531=                that would remedy this violation of the Constitution.
5532=                Q.           Okay.  I want to step back and ask, first
5533=                off, what authorities or guidelines you reviewed prior to
5534=                undertaking your analysis.
5535=                A.           As I state on Page 2 of my report, I followed
5536=                the criteria taken from, quote, guidelines for submission
5537=                of senate or congressional redistricting plans to the
5538=                senate ad hoc committee on redistricting.
5539=                             Those include a bulleted list.  One to be
5540=                composed of continuous districts.  Continuity --
5541=                Q.           And since you're reading, I'm just going to
5542=                encourage you to not read too quickly for the court
5543=                reporter.
5544=                A.           Okay.  Two, be for the State as a whole.
5545=                Plans for the Senate must contain 33 districts.
5546=                             Three, only contain single-member districts.
5547=                             Four, have a population within 10 percent
5548=                overall range, expressed as a percentage, from the
5549=                smallest to the largest district.  The ideal population of
5550=                a senate district is 209,419.  The 10-percent overall
5551=                range is 219,890 to 198,948.
5552=                             And, five, comply with the Voting Rights Act,
fmt=pb
5553=                United States Constitution, and the Tennessee
5554=                Constitution.
5555=                Q.           And on Number 5 there, based on your
5556=                experience that we've already discussed, were you familiar
5557=                with requirements of the Voting Rights Act, U.S.
5558=                Constitution -- well, I'll stop on those two, Voting
5559=                Rights Act and U.S. Constitution.
5560=                A.           Yes.  I -- as I mentioned earlier, I've been
5561=                involved in several federal lawsuits; some of which
5562=                included the Voting Rights Act.  I teach about the Voting
5563=                Rights Act in my class, and I've taken an election law
5564=                class, where we went through the Voting Rights Act
5565=                thoroughly.
5566=                Q.           And did you do anything to familiarize
5567=                yourself with the Tennessee Constitution's requirements
5568=                related to numbering in the Senate?
5569=                A.           I did.  I looked up the provisions in the
5570=                Tennessee Constitution.  If I flip to the next page here,
5571=                on Page 3, there's two more bullet points.  And Bullet
5572=                Point Number 7 is coming from the Tennessee Constitution.
5573=                It says:  All senate districts numbered are sequenced such
5574=                that all districts contained in a single county are
5575=                ordered and skip no numbers.
5576=                Q.           Okay.  All right.  And then I sort of
5577=                interrupted you, going through what authorities or
fmt=pb
5578=                guidelines you followed.
5579=                             So what else did you review to determine the
5580=                parameters of your assignment?
5581=                A.           I reviewed the enacted map, as I mentioned.
5582=                Of course, I reviewed the U.S. census data, as delivered
5583=                in August.  That's the 2020 census data, sometimes known
5584=                as Public Law 94171.
5585=                             I used that data, combined with the boundary
5586=                files, provided by the U.S. census.
5587=                             And that was the entirety of the data that I
5588=                needed to show that there was a violation of the
5589=                Constitution in this case.
5590=                Q.           Okay.  And did you review any guidance on the
5591=                land island situation in the state of Tennessee, and could
5592=                you help us understand what that means?
5593=                A.           Right.
5594=                             Bullet Point Number 6 on that list talks
5595=                about the fact that there are some noncontiguous parts of
5596=                counties themselves.
5597=                             And contiguity, just so we understand what
5598=                that concept is, is that if you're in, say, a county that
5599=                you can walk to all parts of the county without ever
5600=                having to leave the county.
5601=                             And so there are some instances where there
5602=                are small geographic areas that exist just beyond on the
fmt=pb
5603=                border, where you would have to cross into another county.
5604=                             And for the purposes of Tennessee, in
5605=                redistricting, those -- all parts of the county are
5606=                considered contiguous.
5607=                Q.           All right.  Certainly, I'll be referring to
5608=                the map that you reviewed as the enacted senate map.
5609=                             And can we agree that when I'm saying
5610=                "enacted senate map," I'm referring to the map that was
5611=                enacted in February of 2022, and it's now codified at
5612=                Tennessee Code 3-1-102?
5613=                A.           Yes.
5614=                Q.           Now, how did you approach this assignment?
5615=                A.           The first part of the task was to determine
5616=                whether the districts were sequentially numbered.
5617=                             I simply loaded the enacted plan into the
5618=                computer, and I looked at all of the counties that had
5619=                multiple districts and just checked to see whether they
5620=                were ordered, literally, sequentially; 1, 2, 3, 4 . . .
5621=                17, 18, 19, 20.  And Davidson Counties were not.  It was
5622=                missing what should have been their District Number 18.
5623=                             So once I determined that that was the case,
5624=                I wanted to try to think about as if I were -- had been
5625=                appointed by a Court, who had determined that this was a
5626=                constitutional violation.  How I would, for a Court,
5627=                remedy this situation.
fmt=pb
5628=                             And so I redrew the enacted map with as
5629=                minimal amount of change as possible in order to comply
5630=                with the state constitution.
5631=                Q.           Okay.  And in doing so -- I'm going to
5632=                encourage you, whether there's illustrations in the
5633=                document before all of us, you can direct them to us.
5634=                             But did you come up with a first iteration of
5635=                any map that consecutively numbered these four districts?
5636=                A.           I did.  We can find that starting on Page 11.
5637=                And more particularly, Page 12, under the subheader:
5638=                Cervas Senate 1 Plan.
5639=                Q.           All right.  So walk us through -- and we're
5640=                on Page 12, but with the illustration.
5641=                             Walk us through what Cervas Senate Plan --
5642=                what you did to get to Cervas Senate Plan 1.
5643=                A.           Well, let me sort of talk in broad strokes so
5644=                that we're not getting too much into the detail.
5645=                             The way you solve this problem is that all
5646=                the districts inside of Davidson County must be
5647=                sequential.  So you need to have a District 18.
5648=                             So District 17, which was not sequential, is
5649=                the one that needs the change in this circumstance.  And
5650=                District 17 had the parts in Davidson County that were
5651=                adjacent to two bordering counties.  To the north was
5652=                Wilson County, and to the south was Rutherford County.
fmt=pb
5653=                             And so because there's a requirement -- or
5654=                the way that the state senate operates is that
5655=                even-numbered elections are in one two-year cycle, and
5656=                odd-numbered districts are the next two-year cycle.
5657=                             We wanted to try to ensure -- I wanted to try
5658=                to ensure that no incumbent who is in a district that has
5659=                four years left in the term would be subject to a new
5660=                district, where their term might be cut short.
5661=                             And so that required actually changing which
5662=                way the districts went.  And so I eliminated the part of
5663=                District -- what was District 17, what should be District
5664=                18, from Wilson County.  And, instead, took it into
5665=                Rutherford County.
5666=                             And then that required -- because Rutherford
5667=                County has two districts, that it also needs to be
5668=                sequential.  And so I changed the district number, the
5669=                other district in there so that it was odd -- an odd
5670=                number, so that they would be sequential and nobody would
5671=                be caused to lose their two-year term.
5672=                             To do that, I had to take a number from just
5673=                slightly north.  And I have all the details in my report,
5674=                and I can go through it in more detail.
5675=                             But the idea is that you simply have to make
5676=                it so that Davidson County includes a District 18.  And
5677=                you can do it with very, very little disruption of the
fmt=pb
5678=                entire plan.
5679=                Q.           And to that point, did this first iteration
5680=                of your plan alter any of the other three Davidson County
5681=                districts?
5682=                A.           It did not.  Not one of them.
5683=                Q.           And did this plan alter the other Rutherford
5684=                County districts?
5685=                A.           It did not.
5686=                Q.           And did this plan keep incumbents in
5687=                districts that are -- if they were an even district, they
5688=                stayed even, and if they were an odd district, they stayed
5689=                odd?
5690=                A.           I cannot speak affirmatively to that
5691=                statement because I was not provided information about
5692=                where incumbents lived, even though I'd asked for that
5693=                information.  So I can't speak definitively on that fact.
5694=                Q.           Okay.  All right.  And so you went from
5695=                Senate Map 1 to a Senate Map 1A.  I want to understand
5696=                what changes you made to get to 1A and what prompted you
5697=                to make a new plan beyond Senate Plan 1.
5698=                A.           So Cervas Senate 1A Plan starts on Page 14 of
5699=                this report.  And, again, as I mentioned, there were very
5700=                limited changes in the first iteration of this plan.
5701=                             This second iteration is, essentially, the
5702=                same plan, which is indicated by the fact that it has the
fmt=pb
5703=                same number.
5704=                             Here, I wanted to show to the Court that
5705=                there are tradeoffs in redistricting, so that my very
5706=                narrow change of the first map caused that the deviation
5707=                to be quite high in one of the districts.
5708=                             Now, it was within the 10 percent overall
5709=                deviation, but it was higher than maybe we would like.
5710=                And the other district that was in Rutherford County had a
5711=                deviation that was in the other direction; that is to say
5712=                one had too few people and one had too many, which meant
5713=                you can balance those two things together.
5714=                             And in doing so, you can lower the deviation
5715=                of both of those districts.  So now they both have
5716=                populations that are closer to mathematical equality.
5717=                             And so that's all this iteration -- this 1A
5718=                iteration was, was to balance the two districts in the
5719=                Rutherford area.
5720=                Q.           And does this iteration, Concept 1A, as it's
5721=                labeled, keep the other three Davidson County districts
5722=                just as the legislature enacted them?
5723=                A.           My recollection is that there is still no
5724=                change to Davidson County at all, except for in the
5725=                numbering.
5726=                Q.           Okay.  And then you proceeded and created
5727=                Concept Map 1B.  Can you explain to us why you created
fmt=pb
5728=                Concept Map 1B?
5729=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, we would
5730=                object to the mentioning of Senate Plan 1B because the
5731=                only way that it's in the record was through the hyperlink
5732=                in his report.  That hyperlink is dead.  So it's not in
5733=                the record.  It's not with the Court.  We don't have a
5734=                copy.
5735=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Counsel?
5736=                                   MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, that's
5737=                inaccurate.  Everyone in this room with a binder is
5738=                looking at the report that sets forth his map and his
5739=                analysis of his map.
5740=                                   And just like in other -- you know, the
5741=                State never issued any expert interrogatories or request
5742=                for documents to get an underlying shapefile.  And whether
5743=                or not a link has broken on the publically-available link
5744=                to see these reports is really irrelevant to the fact that
5745=                the report -- the map that he created is the map that he
5746=                created.  He summarized it here.  It's referenced here.
5747=                It hasn't changed here.
5748=                                   And, importantly, Defendants chose not
5749=                to offer any contradictory expert testimony whatsoever on
5750=                the senate plan.  They did not hire any experts to
5751=                criticize any maps.  So this is an uncontested report.  It
5752=                still sets forth the exact map, in visual form, and
fmt=pb
5753=                analysis in written form.
5754=                                   So it's just not the case that the map
5755=                is not there anymore.  We're looking at the map, and he's
5756=                walking you through the details of it.
5757=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, to the extent
5758=                he testifies about things like total population deviation,
5759=                voting age population, anything in that map, what's on the
5760=                paper and the report, we can't verify.
5761=                                   And, ultimately, the problem is, when
5762=                you present a map, you have to also present the underlying
5763=                data pursuant to Tennessee Rules of Evidence 705, if
5764=                asked.
5765=                                   The problem is, this map cannot be
5766=                presented in any analyzable form because it's been removed
5767=                from the record because of a dead hyperlink.
5768=                                   It's true we didn't send an
5769=                interrogatory.  But there was an expert report deadline,
5770=                and the Court's order does say anything not timely
5771=                delivered will be struck.
5772=                                   The issue is it's not here to where
5773=                they can be analyzed right now.
5774=                                   The Court doesn't have a copy of the
5775=                shapefile or a Block Assignment File.  It's been removed
5776=                from the record in the only analyzable form it was in.
5777=                So, you know, we don't have the form here, either, in the
fmt=pb
5778=                record with the Court or the defendants have to verify
5779=                this particular plan.
5780=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Counsel?
5781=                                   MR. TIFT:  And we'd submit the
5782=                defendants have certainly waived those concerns, given
5783=                that they made a choice not to analyze these maps, not to
5784=                download the shapefiles, which they downloaded for all of
5785=                the others, which were publically available, not to hire
5786=                an expert to analyze it, not to criticize them in any way,
5787=                and not to contest this claim on the merits.
5788=                                   Dr. Cervas's testimony here is,
5789=                frankly, not necessary, given that they haven't contested
5790=                the merits.  But we understand that it could be useful to
5791=                the Court, should the Court end up having to do an interim
5792=                map to have been able to see the feasibility of this
5793=                claim.
5794=                                   So they made a choice for the last --
5795=                go back to October, to not analyze this map, to not dig
5796=                down and see if the figures that are reflected here that
5797=                haven't changed are accurate or not, not hired an expert
5798=                to do so.  And so they've waived the chance now to say
5799=                they want an ability to analyze it.
5800=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Last remark, and I'll --
5801=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, I would just
5802=                say that this -- his senate maps go towards
fmt=pb
5803=                redressability.  We've already said that any option that
5804=                Dr. Cervas does places legal peril on the map.
5805=                                   We can't waive standing, no more than
5806=                redressability is an element of the standings.  So it's
5807=                absolutely relevant here.
5808=                                   But the issue, again, is that the only
5809=                analyzable form given of this map was through a hyperlink
5810=                on Dave's Redistricting.  It's not on us to prove their
5811=                case.  They're the ones who have to prove their case and
5812=                put on their proof.
5813=                                   The Court doesn't have this map in an
5814=                analyzable form.  I mean, look, the hyperlink is dead.  We
5815=                can't look at it right now if we wanted to pull it up.
5816=                                   So unless the plaintiffs have changed
5817=                that in the last week since I've looked at it, it's a dead
5818=                link.  The map isn't in the record in a form that can be
5819=                analyzed.  Because the data underlying the map has to be
5820=                verifiable and analyzable as well.  Otherwise, we're just
5821=                staring at a piece of paper.
5822=                                   MR. TIFT:  I would point out the Court
5823=                certainly doesn't have to analyze underlying shapefiles.
5824=                You're weighing testimony based on what's put before you.
5825=                                   And, of course, the Court can hear what
5826=                has been the same text, summarizing this data for the last
5827=                five months.  And should, on cross-examination, they
fmt=pb
5828=                convince you that it's uncompelling, that's fine.  It
5829=                won't be -- you know, the other two maps are still in the
5830=                record.
5831=                                   But there's no reason to exclude him
5832=                from testifying about what's been in his report for all
5833=                these months, when the defendants chose to not analyze the
5834=                data at all and not to object at all here.
5835=                                   And, of course, when Dr. Cervas
5836=                previously corrected a link that went broken, they made a
5837=                big point of saying that's spoliation.
5838=                                   So if you want to hear from the
5839=                witness, he'd be happy to reconnect, you know, the
5840=                original files, but not going to do so anymore if they,
5841=                you know, consider that somehow destroying evidence.
5842=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  The Court will overrule
5843=                the objection.  We may be on limited ground here, but you
5844=                can go forward from that.
5845=                BY MR. TIFT:
5846=                Q.           All right.  I was asking you to explain how
5847=                you got to your Concept 1B or what you were seeking to do,
5848=                moving from IA to 1B.
5849=                A.           This is very simple.  It doesn't build too
5850=                much beyond what we already have established here, except
5851=                for that the -- the Davidson County senate districts are
5852=                overpopulated, as they are now, in the enacted map.
fmt=pb
5853=                             And because of the fact that we were able --
5854=                we were doing some slight configuration changes in the
5855=                outlying areas of the districts around it, you can
5856=                actually reduce the population deviation, such that the
5857=                districts are closer to equal population.
5858=                             And I wanted to demonstrate for this Court
5859=                that it could easily be accomplished, given -- it's just
5860=                an additional thing that can -- it's a benefit to voters
5861=                in these areas, to have more equal representation.
5862=                             The spirit of Reynolds versus Sims.  You
5863=                know, one-person, one-vote.
5864=                             And this just demonstrated a very simple,
5865=                easy way to do that under this illustrative plan.
5866=                             And just to clarify, this is not something
5867=                I'm suggesting we should absolutely do right now, take
5868=                this plan and put it into place.  It's just an
5869=                illustration of something that can be done.  This is
5870=                something the Court could order or the legislature could
5871=                do themselves.  Or they could choose to create their own
5872=                map.
5873=                             The underlying data is almost irrelevant.
5874=                It's the point that you can reduce the deviations, which
5875=                is what's important in this particular case -- or this
5876=                particular map.
5877=                Q.           And so, Dr. Cervas, having looked at these
fmt=pb
5878=                examples, I'd like to circle back and understand your
5879=                expert opinion on whether or not the 2020 U.S. census data
5880=                applied to Tennessee allows for Davidson County's four
5881=                senate districts to be consecutively numbered without
5882=                violating any other constitutional or statutory concern.
5883=                A.           Yeah.  There's no reason, in my opinion,
5884=                why -- and no justification for districts to not be
5885=                sequentially numbered in Davidson County.
5886=                             I don't know what the motivation was to not
5887=                do it.  I've heard earlier today that it has happened in
5888=                previous decades.
5889=                             But I read the Constitution as well as
5890=                anybody else can, and the words are abundantly clear that
5891=                districts must be sequentially numbered when there are
5892=                more than one district inside of a county.  And they're
5893=                not.
5894=                             And I've demonstrated that it's very simple
5895=                without even changing most of the legislative intent.  It
5896=                can be done, accomplished without violating any federal
5897=                laws.  And, in fact, lowering -- potentially, lowering the
5898=                population deviations in each of the districts, compliant
5899=                with Reynolds versus Sims.
5900=                Q.           All right.  I'd like to move on now to the
5901=                house claim and the work you've done for that.
5902=                             And I believe we'll start by flipping over to
fmt=pb
5903=                Exhibit 8, which is your initial -- after the temporary
5904=                injunction phase, it's your initial expert report on the
5905=                house claim.  Tab 8.
5906=                             Okay.  So, Dr. Cervas, starting off again,
5907=                like we did with the senate claim, what was your
5908=                assignment concerning the enacted house map?
5909=                A.           Yeah.
5910=                             On the house claim, I was asked by
5911=                Plaintiffs' counsel if it was possible to create a
5912=                compliant map, a map that was compliant with all federal
5913=                and state statutory law that split fewer than 30 counties.
5914=                Q.           And did you reach an opinion concerning
5915=                whether or not the 2020 census data, as applied to
5916=                Tennessee, allowed for fewer county splits in the house
5917=                map, while still complying with federal constitutional
5918=                requirements?
5919=                A.           It's unequivocal that the legislature can
5920=                create a 99-district plan that splits fewer than 30
5921=                counties, including plans that have substantially fewer
5922=                county splits than 30.
5923=                Q.           And we'll go through different examples that
5924=                you have in support of that opinion.
5925=                             But, you know, just in summary, I mean, how
5926=                many splits have you been able to create in your various
5927=                maps?
fmt=pb
5928=                A.           All that data is not in this document.  But
5929=                I'll sort of just say that the range of the county splits
5930=                in the maps that I've created, the illustrative maps I've
5931=                created, range from 22 to 25.
5932=                Q.           Let's start, again, discussing what
5933=                authorities you reviewed or guidelines you reviewed before
5934=                starting your process.
5935=                A.           So upon accepting this task, I looked up the
5936=                state constitution, of course, because that's what one
5937=                would do if you want to comply with the state
5938=                constitution.
5939=                             Additionally, I searched the internet for
5940=                redistricting in Tennessee and was able to find an
5941=                official website from the state government, which I have
5942=                listed the URL for, and the title, on Page 2 of this
5943=                report.
5944=                             It was called the House Select Committee on
5945=                redistricting.  So they have a website, like a portal,
5946=                where you could go to, and it had all kinds of
5947=                information, documents, from the hearing that happened
5948=                from that committee.
5949=                             And from there, I used that document --
5950=                again, that's hyperlinked -- that included a list -- a
5951=                bullet list of items.
5952=                             Would you like me to go through the list
fmt=pb
5953=                or . . .
5954=                Q.           Sure.  Yes.
5955=                A.           So, here, there are roman numerals.  And
5956=                it's -- so the Point 1 is:  Each district must be
5957=                represented by a single member.
5958=                             Point 2:  Districts shall comply with
5959=                constitutional requirements for, quote, one-person,
5960=                one-vote, unquote, as judicially interpreted to apply to
5961=                state legislative districts.
5962=                             3:  Geographic features, boundaries, and
5963=                population figures shall be based on the 2020 decennial
5964=                census.
5965=                             Point 4:  Districts must be contiguous in
5966=                contiguity.  By water is sufficient.
5967=                             Point 5:  No more than 30 counties may be
5968=                split to attach to other counties or parts of counties to
5969=                form multicounty districts.
5970=                             And Point 6:  The redistricting plans shall
5971=                comply with the Voting Rights Act in the constitutions of
5972=                Tennessee and the United States.
5973=                Q.           And I know you've already testified to your
5974=                familiarity with the Voting Rights Act.
5975=                             As to Roman 2, which is the requirement of
5976=                the one-person, one-vote, have you been familiar with
5977=                one-person, one-vote requirements, based on your
fmt=pb
5978=                experience?
5979=                A.           I am.  I mentioned, in my previous statement,
5980=                about Reynolds versus Sims.  I'm actually quite familiar
5981=                with all of the malapportionment court cases, starting in
5982=                the 1960s with Baker versus Carr and Reynolds versus Sims,
5983=                Wesberry versus Sanders, in going on to the 1970s.
5984=                             And so I'm quite familiar with the legal
5985=                standards set out in these court cases under one-person,
5986=                one-vote.
5987=                Q.           Did the Voting Rights Act apply to your
5988=                previous redistricting engagements?
5989=                A.           Well, the redistrict- -- I'm sorry.  The
5990=                Voting Rights Act applies to all redistricting schemes,
5991=                potentially.  It's federal law, first passed in 1965, and
5992=                amended four times, most recently in 2006.  And so it
5993=                applies nationwide.  Section 2 applies nationwide.
5994=                             Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act is no
5995=                longer -- it's -- Section 5 itself is still
5996=                constitutional, but the coverage formula of Section 4,
5997=                which gives weight into Section 5 is no longer relevant
5998=                after Shelby County versus Holder in 2013.
5999=                             In the states I worked in, Section 5 would
6000=                not have been relevant, except for it would have been
6001=                relevant in Virginia, and then Georgia.  It would not have
6002=                been relevant in New York statewide, but it may have been
fmt=pb
6003=                relevant in some of the counties.
6004=                             So its relevance is -- I mean, it's always
6005=                relevant in redistricting; right?  Section 2 is always
6006=                relevant.
6007=                Q.           So is it accurate to say this engagement here
6008=                is not the first time you've had to ensure maps you draw
6009=                are compliant with the Voting Rights Act?
6010=                A.           Compliance with the Voting Rights Act is
6011=                somewhat complicated by the fact that the equal protection
6012=                clause of the U.S. Constitution says that you can't use
6013=                race as a predominant motive.  And, therefore, any use of
6014=                race is subject to strict scrutiny.  And so using race
6015=                needs to be justified under a compelling state interest.
6016=                And that compelling state interest includes the Voting
6017=                Rights Act.
6018=                Q.           And is it accurate to say that in your
6019=                previous engagements you've also had to ensure compliance
6020=                with one-person, one-vote?
6021=                A.           Absolutely.  100 percent.  The number-one
6022=                criteria, because it stems from the U.S. Constitution, is
6023=                one-person, one-vote.  It's subject to U.S. constitutional
6024=                law.
6025=                Q.           Did you review the Constitution itself
6026=                concerning county splits, as you were getting to work on
6027=                this project?
fmt=pb
6028=                A.           For Tennessee?
6029=                Q.           For Tennessee.  Correct.
6030=                             The Tennessee county splitting language?
6031=                A.           Yes.  I did review the Tennessee Constitution
6032=                upon accepting the engagement.
6033=                Q.           And did you -- well, first off, are you aware
6034=                of what the NCSL red book is?
6035=                A.           Yes.  NCSL is the National Conference of
6036=                State Legislatures.  It's a bipartisan, nonpartisan
6037=                organization that provides information to state
6038=                legislators.
6039=                             I have, in previous times, given
6040=                presentations to the NCSL.  And they are a wonderful
6041=                resource, and they provide this book called -- we just --
6042=                NCSL redistricting red book law.  And it is a thick
6043=                textbook, and I literally use it as a textbook in my
6044=                class.  My students have to read the textbook.  It's so
6045=                good.  And it goes through all the federal and state laws
6046=                regarding redistricting.
6047=                Q.           All right.  And did you review the red book
6048=                before getting to work in this case?
6049=                A.           Yes.  I've had the red book for -- probably
6050=                since 2019, when it came out.  And I've used it in my
6051=                class for three consecutive years.
6052=                Q.           I want to look in your report.  The report
fmt=pb
6053=                we're looking at, you made various illustrative maps.
6054=                Some of them start with the Numeral 13, and some of them
6055=                are denoted with Numeral 14, and some of them have the
6056=                Numeral 13.5.
6057=                             Can you explain just the difference, as we're
6058=                going to look at some of these maps, what that signifies?
6059=                A.           They're signifying that these maps have
6060=                different, sort of, objectives.
6061=                             And I named it 13 because those maps, all
6062=                each have exactly 13 districts inside of Shelby County,
6063=                identical to the districts in the enacted plan.
6064=                             The 14 refers to the fact that there are 14
6065=                districts inside of Shelby County, which could potentially
6066=                be drawn in any way suitable by the legislature,
6067=                contingent upon being compliant with the Voting Rights
6068=                Act.
6069=                             And the 13.5 indicates that I've treated
6070=                Shelby County slightly differently, and I think we'll
6071=                probably -- because I talk about these in my reports.
6072=                             But Shelby County has a population that could
6073=                justify either 13 districts or 14 districts.  And another
6074=                option ought to be that one district can cross over to an
6075=                adjacent county so that all of the districts have,
6076=                approximately, equal population.
6077=                             Again, consistent with Reynolds versus Sims,
fmt=pb
6078=                having districts as equal as practicable.
6079=                Q.           And so just connecting the dots, what does
6080=                13.5 refer to on that matrix?
6081=                A.           13.5 -- I've created two plans that are in
6082=                the 13.5 series, where a part of Shelby County is
6083=                connected to an adjacent county to form an entire
6084=                district.
6085=                Q.           All right.  Let's talk about your map --
6086=                             Well, actually, I'd like to ask, in case -- I
6087=                don't know if there are any differences.
6088=                             But on Page 6, you discuss what data, sort
6089=                of, underlie your work.  And I know you already did that
6090=                with the senate map.
6091=                             But is the data underlying the same, or are
6092=                there any differences to the underlying data?
6093=                A.           No.  The underlying data is exactly the same.
6094=                The population base comes from the U.S. census.  It's the
6095=                same for the State House and the State Senate.
6096=                Q.           All right.  So let's talk about Map 13A,
6097=                which there's an illustration of it on Page 14 of your
6098=                map.  I want to step back and understand, that you're
6099=                starting this report, how did you get to Map 13A?
6100=                A.           So as I said, Map 13 means that Shelby County
6101=                has 13 districts.  Now, Shelby County enacted plan has
6102=                exactly 13 districts.  And so instead of redrawing those
fmt=pb
6103=                districts, I decided to leave them exactly as is, before
6104=                trying to reduce the number of county splits.
6105=                             Additionally, Counsel informed me that the
6106=                State of Tennessee suggests that other large metropolitan
6107=                areas that have multiple districts ought not ever cross
6108=                the county line.  So there's no particular reason to
6109=                change several of these counties at all.
6110=                             And so limiting myself to only those
6111=                non-urban counties, the question was, can I reduce the
6112=                number of county splits, holding those as they were in the
6113=                enacted map?
6114=                Q.           And to understand that a little bit more,
6115=                those larger counties that you're speaking about, did they
6116=                include the type of county split crossing the county line
6117=                in the enacted house map?
6118=                A.           Can you repeat that question?
6119=                Q.           Yeah.
6120=                             If you're talking about having left the
6121=                largest of the counties exactly as the legislature enacted
6122=                them, as they were enacted, did they themselves have a
6123=                county split, where they were pairing, for instance, part
6124=                of Davidson with a neighboring county?
6125=                A.           No.  They -- these -- all those urban
6126=                counties -- so this includes -- so, obviously, Shelby
6127=                County, as I mentioned.  Davidson County, Hamilton County,
fmt=pb
6128=                and Knox County.
6129=                             Those counties all have some number of
6130=                districts inside of them, and they don't cross the county
6131=                border at all.  So I kept that exactly as it was in the
6132=                enacted map.  So those districts didn't change at all.
6133=                Q.           And so in the end, in 13A, do you know how
6134=                many of the enacted house maps districts stayed exactly
6135=                the same as they were in the enacted house map?
6136=                A.           So, in addition to those Shelby -- the urban
6137=                counties, including Shelby and Davidson and Knox and
6138=                Hamilton, there was several other districts that I was
6139=                able to keep 100-percent exactly the same.
6140=                             And it ended up being, in this particular
6141=                map, 51 of the 99 had absolutely no change at all from the
6142=                legislature's enacted map.
6143=                Q.           Okay.  So I think we stopped to add some more
6144=                details there.
6145=                             But you were, I believe, saying that you
6146=                started with preserving some of the districts.  And then
6147=                take us through what you did after that.
6148=                A.           And so once I had preserved those districts,
6149=                I wanted to -- the question was, was it possible for the
6150=                legislature to draw a map that reduced the number of
6151=                county splits?
6152=                             And so that process involves finding
fmt=pb
6153=                combinations of counties that -- because the rest of the
6154=                counties have populations that are quite small and need to
6155=                be added to other counties in order to form districts.
6156=                             And so I looked for combinations of counties,
6157=                where you wouldn't have to actually take only a partial.
6158=                So combining full counties.  And doing that to the
6159=                greatest degree possible, combining full counties, in the
6160=                spirit of the Tennessee Constitution that says:  Don't
6161=                divide any counties.
6162=                             So I tried to not divide any counties.
6163=                Q.           Okay.  And as a result of that process, how
6164=                many counties did your final 13A divide?
6165=                A.           I'm going to flip to my table, just so I get
6166=                the data correct.
6167=                             I provide a summary table on Page 18, include
6168=                a comparison to the enacted map.  And so Cervas House Map
6169=                13A ends up with what I label TN County Splits, which is
6170=                the equivalent to the way Mr. Himes counts the splits, as
6171=                24 total splits.
6172=                Q.           Okay.  And that's compared to the enacted
6173=                house maps 30 splits; correct?
6174=                A.           Exactly correct.
6175=                Q.           Now, what about on one-person, one-vote?  Was
6176=                this map below a 10-percent population variation?
6177=                A.           Yes, it was.
fmt=pb
6178=                Q.           Okay.  What is the population -- total
6179=                population deviation in this map?
6180=                A.           9.96 percent.
6181=                Q.           Okay.  And at this stage, you know, did you
6182=                actively try to reduce that number lower than 9.96?
6183=                A.           Because, by necessity, by limiting the number
6184=                of county splits, you increase the total variance, which
6185=                is exactly in the spirit of Reynolds versus Sims.
6186=                             That Court had said that states have a
6187=                compelling interest to not split counties.  And so we're
6188=                going to allow some deviation.  And so the result was a
6189=                9.96 total deviation, with the benefit of having only 24
6190=                county splits.
6191=                Q.           And were there any limitations that you
6192=                confronted in terms of being able to lower a variation,
6193=                based on districts that you didn't change at all?
6194=                A.           So keeping in mind that I did not change 51
6195=                total districts in this plan, that means whatever
6196=                deviation those districts currently had continue to
6197=                persist in the plan that I've created.
6198=                             I did not create this plan, what I would say
6199=                de novo.  Like, I didn't start from a blank slate.  I
6200=                started from a 51-district map, and then filled in the
6201=                areas.  And so I was constrained by the fact that some of
6202=                those districts had quite high deviations.
fmt=pb
6203=                Q.           Okay.  Now, when you were drawing this map,
6204=                did you draw it with an eye towards race as a demographic
6205=                to consider while you were drawing it?
6206=                A.           No.  In fact, upon working on this particular
6207=                plan, 13A, I used absolutely no race in the drawing of
6208=                this plan.
6209=                             Now, I understand -- I'd already understood
6210=                that almost all of the VRA-required districts would be in
6211=                those urban counties that I didn't change anyways.
6212=                             And I mentioned earlier the equal protection
6213=                clause of the U.S. Constitution says that we can't use
6214=                race in impermissible ways.
6215=                             So instead of trying to draw with race in any
6216=                way, I just didn't draw with race at all.
6217=                Q.           And at some point, after creating the
6218=                race-blind map, did you then look at how race was treated
6219=                in the map?
6220=                A.           Yeah.
6221=                             So upon completing the plan, I have access to
6222=                the demographic data at the district level, to see what
6223=                each district was.
6224=                             And I know, from the enacted plan, that there
6225=                were 13 districts that had a majority-minority population.
6226=                Whether those were required of the Voting Rights Act or
6227=                not, I'm unaware of because no Voting Rights Act analysis
fmt=pb
6228=                had been -- as far as I know, was not done.  It was
6229=                certainly not provided to me and was not available on the
6230=                Tennessee website.
6231=                             So I operated under the assumption that all
6232=                13 of those would have been required, and noticed that I
6233=                only had 12 in this map, which meant that I would have
6234=                retrogressed, moved backward.
6235=                             Now, retrogression is not a standard anymore,
6236=                after Shelby County versus Holder, but it's still an
6237=                important way to try to determine whether you've complied
6238=                with the Voting Rights Act.
6239=                             If you've gone backward, if you've reduced
6240=                the number of minority districts, there's a good chance
6241=                that you may have violated the Voting Rights Act.
6242=                             And so from that point, I identified at what
6243=                part of the state -- keeping in mind that I didn't change
6244=                any districts in Shelby County, or Davidson, or Hamilton,
6245=                or in Knoxville.  So which part of the state did that
6246=                district disappear from?
6247=                             And it was from a rural area in West
6248=                Tennessee.  And it would have been what in the enacted map
6249=                is District 80, is currently a majority-minority district.
6250=                Q.           Okay.  And so if you can just, once more --
6251=                because it's a term we haven't discussed before today, and
6252=                it seems like a term of art.
fmt=pb
6253=                             Just, once more, explain to us what
6254=                retrogression means when you're using that term.
6255=                A.           Yeah.  I don't have to use that term if we
6256=                don't like the term.  But the term simply means that
6257=                you've reduced the number of effective majority
6258=                opportunity districts.
6259=                             So in the Voting Rights Act, if a state
6260=                enacted a plan that previously had 13, then in a
6261=                redistricting, enacted a plan that only had 12, they've
6262=                retrogressed, they've moved backward, they've eliminated
6263=                one seat.
6264=                Q.           And did your identification of retrogression
6265=                and your Map 13A give you any concern about Map 13A?
6266=                A.           Yeah.  I knew immediately that 13A would
6267=                be -- given the fact that District 80 clearly, just from
6268=                looking at the demographics of the Rural West Tennessee
6269=                area, that almost certainly a Voting Rights Act district
6270=                would be required there.
6271=                             And so Map 13A would not have been one that
6272=                would have been satisfactory to comply with federal law.
6273=                Q.           Okay.  And so if you don't deem Map 13A
6274=                satisfactory to comply with federal law, why did you
6275=                include it in your report?
6276=                A.           For transparency purposes and to show that I
6277=                didn't use race in an impermissible way.  It was important
fmt=pb
6278=                for me to include this map for the Court so they
6279=                understood that sometimes when you draw race blind, it can
6280=                cause the problem of eliminating districts that are
6281=                required by the federal law.  And only after looking at
6282=                the map after the fact can you verify that that is true.
6283=                             And so I wanted to include this for
6284=                transparency purposes.  But in no way would I recommend
6285=                this map because I do believe it conflicts with federal
6286=                law.
6287=                Q.           Okay.  And so did that cause you to move on
6288=                and make Map 13B?
6289=                A.           It did.  So --
6290=                Q.           And I'll just say, and walk us through sort
6291=                of the process of creating Map 13B.
6292=                A.           So Map 13B is simply a response to the fact
6293=                that I had retrogressed on that district.  And still
6294=                without using race in any impermissible way, I wanted to
6295=                redraw from that map, map -- District 80, that would be
6296=                compliant with the Voting Rights Act, while still keeping
6297=                the plan largely the same.
6298=                Q.           Okay.  And so, I guess, what changes did you
6299=                make that got you to 13B?
6300=                A.           Yeah.  So it's going to require changes to
6301=                any district that is adjacent to those districts -- that
6302=                district that I was forced to change.  And I'm not sure I
fmt=pb
6303=                have the details written in here, about which specific
6304=                lines had to move.
6305=                             But the bottom line is that in Map 13B,
6306=                District 80 now is one with a population that is greater
6307=                than 50-percent black voting age population.
6308=                             And in -- after I had delivered this report,
6309=                Defendants' expert, Mr. Trende, analyzed the plan for
6310=                Voting Rights Act, and agrees that it would be compliant
6311=                with the Voting Rights Act.
6312=                Q.           And so is this district in Map 13B, that's a
6313=                majority-minority district, also numbered District 80?
6314=                A.           I believe that's correct.
6315=                Q.           And let's talk about the --
6316=                             Well, in creating that district, were you
6317=                aware of where the incumbent from District 80 previously
6318=                lived?
6319=                A.           At this point, when I wrote this report, I
6320=                had asked for incumbency information, as I mentioned on
6321=                the senate map, and was told it was not available.  It was
6322=                not available on the State's website, which is not totally
6323=                surprising because these are addresses of legislators.
6324=                And so to not make that public is understandable.
6325=                             And so I did not have any information about
6326=                any of the incumbents, nor do I know any of these
6327=                incumbents.  I don't know where they live.
fmt=pb
6328=                             In many ways, I've shielded myself from any
6329=                effects of partisanship in this.  From the very beginning,
6330=                I wanted to have as little knowledge about those kinds of
6331=                things as possible, and only try to create maps that are
6332=                compliant with law.
6333=                Q.           So is it accurate that for this entire
6334=                report, everything in it, you did not have data concerning
6335=                where incumbents lived?
6336=                A.           For this entire report, I had absolutely no
6337=                information on incumbency.
6338=                Q.           And you may have said this.  But Map 13B,
6339=                what is its total number of majority-minority districts?
6340=                A.           It will have the same number as the enacted
6341=                plan, 13 majority-minority districts.
6342=                Q.           And what total population variance is
6343=                reflected in Map 13B?
6344=                A.           This also has a 9.96 overall deviation.
6345=                Q.           And how many county splits does this Map 13B
6346=                have?
6347=                A.           This one is the map that has the most of all
6348=                the illustrative maps that I've presented, and it's 25.
6349=                Q.           Okay.  And do you recall what led to an
6350=                increase of one split between the Map 13A and 13B?
6351=                A.           I can't speak to what exactly.  There were
6352=                somewhat significant changes required in order to
fmt=pb
6353=                accommodate that district.  And so somewhere it made
6354=                that -- some combination had to go away to create another
6355=                combination of counties, and it added one split in doing
6356=                so.
6357=                             This is part of the tradeoffs of
6358=                redistricting, is that federal law requires us to do
6359=                things, and sometimes that increases the number of county
6360=                splits.  And this is a circumstance it which it did
6361=                increase by one county split.
6362=                Q.           Now, let me ask, in making Map 13B, did you
6363=                try to preserve the cores of previous districts from the
6364=                2010 map?
6365=                A.           No -- well, I'll say no, that I didn't try in
6366=                the areas in which I was seeking to reduce the number of
6367=                total county splits because the Constitution doesn't say
6368=                anything about core preservation.  And none of the
6369=                websites said anything about core preservation.
6370=                             So all of the information that I had at the
6371=                time suggested that there was no particular reason to
6372=                preserve the cores, nor is it my opinion that one should
6373=                preserve the cores, if it conflicts with the state
6374=                constitution.
6375=                             And so I did not try to preserve cores.  But
6376=                that being said, 51 districts are preserved, identical, in
6377=                this map.  51 out of 99 are identical to the enacted map,
fmt=pb
6378=                which, by definition, is core preservation.
6379=                Q.           Now, at some point after submitting this map,
6380=                this report, did you subsequently become aware of
6381=                Defendants' criticism that these maps were -- included
6382=                some zero population or non-contiguities.
6383=                A.           Yes.  After I delivered this report, there
6384=                was a response that indicated that there were some -- in
6385=                this particular report, noncontiguous individual census
6386=                blocks containing zero people.
6387=                Q.           And let's break down.  We've got several
6388=                terms that those of us who aren't in the field may need to
6389=                walk through more in detail.
6390=                             Can you explain to us what a census block is,
6391=                as the first point?
6392=                A.           My pleasure.
6393=                             The census, when it delivers its data, what I
6394=                call the PL94171 data, that is -- actually, the census
6395=                itself calls it redistricting data.  And a census block is
6396=                the lowest-level geography that the census delivers.
6397=                             So the census cannot provide information
6398=                about individual people because it would make people's
6399=                privacy -- privacy concerns.  So they have to aggregate
6400=                the data up a little bit.  And so they create what's
6401=                called a census block.
6402=                             So instead of identifying each person at each
fmt=pb
6403=                address, they create what are, essentially, neighborhoods.
6404=                They're very, very, very small geographically.  In
6405=                Nashville, they're probably no more than one square block.
6406=                In some areas, they will be slightly larger geographically
6407=                than an actual block.  But, usually, there are about ten
6408=                people in them.
6409=                             And the point of these census blocks is so
6410=                that when states have to do redistricting, that they can
6411=                create districts that are as equal as practicable with --
6412=                and depending on whether it's congressional or state
6413=                legislative redistricting, consistent with the court cases
6414=                from the 1960s.
6415=                             So this product was only started after those
6416=                court cases, that the census started delivering these very
6417=                small-level geography.  And there are -- I should know off
6418=                the top of my head.
6419=                             But I would guess that there's probably close
6420=                to several hundred thousand census blocks or a couple
6421=                hundred thousand census blocks in this state.  I think
6422=                somewhere I have a footnote, maybe it's 197,000 census
6423=                blocks.  So a very large number in the state of Tennessee.
6424=                Q.           And why does having census blocks be --
6425=                particularly small measure, aid in creating equal
6426=                population maps?
6427=                A.           So you can imagine if you have -- well,
fmt=pb
6428=                counties themselves are far too large in some
6429=                circumstances to create districts.
6430=                             So in a small county, the whole county might
6431=                be assigned to one district.  But in a large county, you
6432=                might have -- as Shelby County, you might have 13, 13 and
6433=                a half, or 14 districts.  And so you need this fine grain
6434=                population data in order to create districts that have
6435=                equal population.
6436=                             And the standard in congressional
6437=                redistricting is exactly one person.  So the districts
6438=                have to have no more than a deviation of one person.
6439=                             So if the district size is, say, 700,000,
6440=                every district must have exactly 700,000 or 700,001, or
6441=                699,999.  And that's the deviation allowable in
6442=                congressional redistricting.
6443=                             That's not the case we're worried about here.
6444=                We're allowed to have a deviation of 10 percent.
6445=                             But, still, in these larger counties
6446=                especially, or in counties that end up being divided,
6447=                because of the necessity to comply with one-person,
6448=                one-vote, these census blocks become very important for
6449=                creating equal population districts.
6450=                Q.           All right.  And you just mentioned, under
6451=                equal population law, an allowance of a 10-percent
6452=                deviation.  Can you explain to us your understanding of
fmt=pb
6453=                the importance of the 10-percent number?
6454=                A.           Yeah.
6455=                             So courts after -- in Reynolds versus Sims
6456=                and in subsequent cases upholding those decisions settled
6457=                on what might be termed a bright-line test, that any plan
6458=                that has below a 10-percent deviation is presumed
6459=                constitutional.
6460=                             Now, it's presumed constitutional, but it is
6461=                a rebuttable presumption.  So somebody can come in and
6462=                claim that the legislature did not actively try to reduce
6463=                the population deviations and could prevail on that claim,
6464=                even if it's under 10 percent.
6465=                             Likewise, it could be over 10 percent, and
6466=                that's a rebuttable presumption too; right?
6467=                             So if a state has a compelling state interest
6468=                to have a population deviation slightly higher than 10
6469=                percent, the Courts may allow that, but only if there's a
6470=                compelling state interest.
6471=                Q.           All right.  Now, getting back to
6472=                non-contiguities, can you explain to us what a
6473=                non-contiguity is the context of redistricting?
6474=                A.           So similar to how I -- to explain contiguity
6475=                in the terms of a county, you can think of it in the exact
6476=                same terms as a district.  We draw political districts.
6477=                             And one requirement in almost every state is
fmt=pb
6478=                that they are contiguous.  And that means that you can
6479=                walk to any part, or drive to, any part of the district
6480=                and get to any other point of the district without ever
6481=                leaving that district.
6482=                             So this room -- anything that's within the
6483=                walls of this room would be contiguous.  But the next room
6484=                over with a door would not be contiguous; right?  Because
6485=                you have to go through something else to get to it.
6486=                             And so contiguity just means that you can
6487=                walk to any part of it -- of the district without leaving
6488=                it.
6489=                Q.           Okay.  And what is a zero population
6490=                non-contiguity?
6491=                A.           This is not even a real term, really.  It --
6492=                but what we're referring to with zero population
6493=                non-contiguity is simply that the noncontiguous part
6494=                doesn't have any people, which means it doesn't affect the
6495=                variance.  It has no effect at all on the plan.
6496=                             And in the situation in which we're talking
6497=                about, these were sort of unintentional technical things.
6498=                             Districting plans are -- are -- what they
6499=                really are, are a spreadsheet with two columns and 197,000
6500=                rows with a census block being identified in the district.
6501=                And all it means is, simply, that one census block had
6502=                been misidentified into the wrong district.  And that
fmt=pb
6503=                census block itself has no population.
6504=                Q.           And the defendants identified for you in
6505=                these maps certain zero population noncontiguous consensus
6506=                blocks; correct?
6507=                A.           Yes.
6508=                Q.           Why didn't you identify these noncontinuous
6509=                census blocks in the first place when making the maps?
6510=                A.           So I -- upon first being engaged in this
6511=                lawsuit, I inquired about getting a license for Maptitude
6512=                for redistricting.  It's premier software used by
6513=                redistrictors.  And I called up the folks at Maptitude.
6514=                             I've used the software in the past.  I have a
6515=                license through my engagement in Pennsylvania.  So I --
6516=                when I created the maps for the state of Pennsylvania, I
6517=                used Maptitude.
6518=                             When I called those folks up, they wanted to
6519=                charge me $10,000 to get the data for Tennessee, licensing
6520=                data for Tennessee.  And that's pretty cost-prohibitive.
6521=                             In New York -- or let me walk that back and
6522=                say I'd already been using Dave's Redistricting app for a
6523=                long time.  This is a free public open source software
6524=                that any one of us can go create an account, for free, and
6525=                can create your own redistricting maps.  It has all the
6526=                data that we need, all of the redistricting data provided
6527=                by the census, in a very convenient and easy to use sort
fmt=pb
6528=                of on your web browser system.
6529=                             And my mentor used it when he was the special
6530=                master in Virginia.  I'd already been using it in my
6531=                private life, to teach my classes.  And even in New York
6532=                when I was special master, it's the software package I
6533=                used.  I chose not to spend the $10,000 on the data from
6534=                the expensive package, and instead use this Dave's
6535=                Redistricting.
6536=                             It's been around for a while, but it's gotten
6537=                very, very powerful and very, very good in the last
6538=                several years.  And it is now powerful enough to actually
6539=                do these tasks of redistricting without using the more
6540=                expensive software.
6541=                             And so I was using that software.  And built
6542=                into that software are the precincts from the state of
6543=                Tennessee.  And so when I was building my districts, I
6544=                will -- instead of building with the 197,000 census
6545=                blocks -- you know, that would take a long time to
6546=                individually allocate.  You use the precincts, which are
6547=                much larger, about 2,000 per precinct.  And so you can
6548=                much more quickly allocate precincts to the districts.
6549=                             For some reason -- and I believe it relates
6550=                to the fact that precincts themselves are sometimes
6551=                noncontiguous or have really bizarre shapes, oftentimes
6552=                resulting from the boundaries of lakes or other geography
fmt=pb
6553=                features.  It caused several of the districts to end up
6554=                with these non-contiguities.
6555=                             So the only way you could physically see
6556=                these things is if you zoomed so far into them.  You can't
6557=                see them on these maps that are printed in the report
6558=                because they are so small.  I mean, we're talking about,
6559=                like, neighborhood, as I said.  And so you have to zoom in
6560=                so far that it just wasn't something on my radar.
6561=                             Now, Dave's Redistricting has this tool built
6562=                in.  It's a drop-down and it allows you to find
6563=                non-contiguities.  It's supposed to speed up that process
6564=                because they are so small sometimes.
6565=                             And when I was working on these reports, we
6566=                did that, and it never identified any noncontiguous areas.
6567=                             Throughout this process, as I would deliver a
6568=                map and Mr. Himes would put it into Maptitude -- again,
6569=                that's the $10,000 software -- he would be able to
6570=                identify these noncontiguous areas.
6571=                             And after a while, I was sort of getting a
6572=                little bit fed up with the fact that I wasn't finding
6573=                these things, that it wasn't identifying them.
6574=                             And so I contacted Dave's Redistricting and
6575=                said, "Here's the situation.  I'm drawing maps in
6576=                Tennessee.  And I run them through the contiguity checker,
6577=                and it's not identifying them.  And, yet, I know factually
fmt=pb
6578=                that there are noncontiguous parts of these maps.  Can you
6579=                help me figure out what's going on?"
6580=                             After a few days, they had returned that they
6581=                had figured out that it was related to the precincts in
6582=                the way that their system identified non-contiguities.
6583=                But they weren't sure exactly what it was, but they were
6584=                going to rewrite the program using a different method to
6585=                identify noncontiguous areas.
6586=                             This was -- now, we're talking only a couple
6587=                months ago, when they finally got around to fixing the
6588=                software.  And this was all happening during, you know,
6589=                Christmas and other holidays.
6590=                             So it wasn't until much more recently that
6591=                they actually fixed this.  But they've e-mailed me since
6592=                and have said that they fixed this tool.
6593=                             And I checked it, and it seems to -- if I go
6594=                back to some of these original maps and see the tool, it
6595=                actually shows now that there are noncontiguous parts.  So
6596=                it appears that they have fixed this tool.  They've told
6597=                me they fixed it, and it appears to be fixed.
6598=                             But that's -- to answer your question in a
6599=                very long way, that's what happened.
6600=                Q.           So let me be clear.  When first drafting
6601=                these, did you check the non-contiguity tool to see if
6602=                Dave's told you there were any non-contiguities in them?
fmt=pb
6603=                A.           I did check.
6604=                Q.           And, now, have you gone back to look at them,
6605=                and do they now reflect non-contiguities in them?
6606=                A.           They now -- these original maps -- before
6607=                the -- I have issued corrections to all these maps, even
6608=                before the software had been corrected.
6609=                             But these maps now -- the original maps do
6610=                now show that they're noncontiguous.  So I -- if I had had
6611=                that availability at the time, we never would have had the
6612=                circumstance of having any of these non-contiguities.
6613=                Q.           And you just stated this.  But for the maps
6614=                in this report, did you, in your rebuttal report, issue
6615=                correction maps that corrected the zero population
6616=                noncontiguous census blocks?
6617=                A.           Yes, I did issue corrections to these plans,
6618=                thanking Mr. Himes for identifying these, what I call,
6619=                technical errors.  Obviously, unintentional, and minor,
6620=                and they're not relevant at all to the underlying premise
6621=                and data that the State could have reduced the number of
6622=                county splits far below the enacted plan.  That opinion
6623=                still -- it still holds exactly the same weight as the
6624=                maps with the contiguity as they're corrected.
6625=                Q.           And did correcting the non-contiguities or
6626=                noncontiguous census blocks in the maps in this report
6627=                affect the map's variance at all?
fmt=pb
6628=                A.           All of the maps that I've created in this
6629=                report, when they have the non-contiguity corrected, does
6630=                not affect the deviation or the splits at all.  The data
6631=                is identical, exactly the same, not a fraction, not -- no
6632=                differences.
6633=                Q.           And why is it that correcting a zero
6634=                population noncontiguous census block doesn't affect the
6635=                population numbers?
6636=                A.           Well, it's not possible to change the
6637=                population number in any district if you allocate a block
6638=                with no population to a different district.  It won't
6639=                change the population because there's no people.
6640=                Q.           And let me ask -- you may have just said
6641=                this.  But after correcting noncontiguous census blocks
6642=                for each of these maps in your report, did the number of
6643=                county splits change at all?
6644=                A.           The number of county splits --
6645=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  I would object for
6646=                leading.
6647=                                   THE WITNESS:  Well, I actually just
6648=                said that.
6649=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Wait just a second.
6650=                                   You may respond.  He objected to
6651=                leading.
6652=                                   MR. TIFT:  I don't need to lead him,
fmt=pb
6653=                Your Honor.  I think I can -- I actually don't think the
6654=                question was leading, but I can ask it again.
6655=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.  Go ahead.
6656=                BY MR. TIFT:
6657=                Q.           Dr. Cervas, you just testified that you
6658=                corrected the non-contiguities in these maps; correct?
6659=                A.           That's right.
6660=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, we would also
6661=                object to any -- testifying about any map that we haven't
6662=                seen, a map without these contiguities and maps we haven't
6663=                seen.  They're not in the record.  They're not in the
6664=                reports.
6665=                                   MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, I'll point to
6666=                you where they are in the record and are in the reports to
6667=                respond to that.  Can I point him to his next report to
6668=                answer that objection?
6669=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Yes.
6670=                BY MR. TIFT:
6671=                Q.           All right.  If we look at Number 9.
6672=                             All right.  Tab 9, Exhibit 9 is your rebuttal
6673=                report; is that right?
6674=                A.           Yes.
6675=                Q.           Did you publish links to the corrected maps
6676=                in this report?
6677=                A.           Yes.  I -- Paragraph 1 of this report on
fmt=pb
6678=                Page 2 is -- the subtitle is:  Noncontiguous Census
6679=                Blocks.
6680=                Q.           Okay.  And walk me through what the links are
6681=                on Page 5 at the bottom.
6682=                A.           Page 5 contains Footnotes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
6683=                14.  And those are links to Dave's Redistricting app, the
6684=                same way I've delivered every other map in this court
6685=                case.  And those are links to what I've called maps:
6686=                Cervas House Map 13B_e, Cervas House Map 14A_e, Cervas
6687=                House Map 13.5A_e, and Cervas House Maps 13.5B_e.
6688=                Q.           Okay.  And are those links pointing to maps
6689=                where you've corrected the non-contiguities you were just
6690=                speaking about?
6691=                A.           Yes.
6692=                             And let me clarify --
6693=                                   MR. TIFT:  Let me stop there.
6694=                                   So I'll respond to the objection that
6695=                these have, in fact, been produced.  They're here in this
6696=                report with the links.  And so they have been produced to
6697=                the parties.
6698=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, it was
6699=                unclear.  We'd just ask that they identify what maps we're
6700=                talking about before, so if there is a map that's not in
6701=                the record, we can't object to it.
6702=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Overruled.
fmt=pb
6703=                BY MR. TIFT:
6704=                Q.           All right.  I believe I've consistently been
6705=                asking you about the maps reflected in this report, but
6706=                I'm still asking you about the maps in your expert report.
6707=                             Okay.  So other than responding to their
6708=                objection, we've been looking at your primary first expert
6709=                report, which has five maps, and speaking about those five
6710=                maps; correct?
6711=                A.           Yes.
6712=                Q.           All right.  Let's return to doing that.
6713=                             We talked about A and B and that they had
6714=                non-contiguities.
6715=                             I'm curious, did you attempt to fix the
6716=                non-contiguities in A?
6717=                A.           I did not.
6718=                Q.           Why not?
6719=                A.           As I mentioned earlier, Map 13A is not a map
6720=                that I would recommend because it almost certainly
6721=                violates the Voting Rights Act.
6722=                Q.           All right.  But for the other maps, 13B, 14A,
6723=                13.5A, and 13.5B, did you correct the non-contiguities and
6724=                publish those links in your rebuttal report?
6725=                A.           I did.
6726=                Q.           And did correcting any of those zero
6727=                population non-contiguities affect the variance in any way
fmt=pb
6728=                of those maps?
6729=                A.           They did not.
6730=                Q.           All right.  Let's look at that rebuttal
6731=                report now.  We are now on Exhibit Number 9.  I'll make it
6732=                clear if I'm going back to Exhibit Number 8.  We're
6733=                talking about Exhibit Number 9.
6734=                             Exhibit Number 9 is your rebuttal report,
6735=                which you produced on December 2nd, 2022.  Do you have
6736=                that in front of you now?
6737=                A.           I do.
6738=                Q.           Okay.  And exhibit number -- in your rebuttal
6739=                report, you provide two maps; is that correct?
6740=                A.           Two new maps, yes.
6741=                Q.           And they're labeled 13C and 13D; correct?
6742=                A.           That's correct.
6743=                Q.           Now, does the number 13 in these map titles
6744=                signify, you know, what you stated before about the number
6745=                of districts in Shelby County?
6746=                A.           That's right.  It's still 13 districts inside
6747=                of Shelby County, unadjusted at all from the enacted map.
6748=                                   MR. TIFT:  All right.  Your Honors,
6749=                we're about 15 minutes until 5:00.  Should we still expect
6750=                that we're stopping at 5:00?  I may jump a little forward
6751=                to touch one discreet topic, and then we'd be done.  But
6752=                it would take a little longer to get there.  I just want
fmt=pb
6753=                to clarify.  Should I assume we have 15 minutes at this
6754=                point?
6755=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Yeah.  15 minutes, or we
6756=                can adjourn before then, if you so choose.
6757=                                   MR. TIFT:  One second.
6758=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, I realize the
6759=                Court has set the deadline at 5:00.  But if he's going to
6760=                be done shortly after 5:00, we can stay five or ten
6761=                minutes if that will get it done, just for completeness.
6762=                But . . .
6763=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  We have little
6764=                flexibility --
6765=                                   MR. TIFT:  Sorry.  Let me clarify.
6766=                We're not going to be done with Dr. Cervas that quickly.
6767=                There was just one -- a point on non-contiguities that I
6768=                thought I might jump to, if we were about there.
6769=                                   Give me one last second.
6770=                BY MR. TIFT:
6771=                Q.           All right.  Dr. Cervas, we're going to look
6772=                at a subsequent exhibit.  Exhibit 10.  Turning to that.
6773=                That's a January 9th, 2023, supplemental report.
6774=                             Do you have that before you?
6775=                A.           I do.
6776=                Q.           And turn to the map on Page 2 here.
6777=                             Do you see the map on Page 2?
fmt=pb
6778=                A.           I do.
6779=                Q.           And it reflects Map 13D_e.  Do you recognize
6780=                that?
6781=                A.           Yes.
6782=                Q.           And did you create Map 13D_e for this report?
6783=                A.           I did.
6784=                Q.           And did you, at any point, subsequently learn
6785=                of non-contiguities in this Map 13D_e?
6786=                A.           I was -- I became aware of those
6787=                non-contiguities after I delivered the previous report.
6788=                Q.           Okay.  And what -- you know, do you remember
6789=                specifically which non-contiguities were identified in
6790=                criticism of this map, like how many non-contiguities?
6791=                A.           I believe there was three total in the entire
6792=                state.
6793=                Q.           Okay.  And do you recall how many of them
6794=                were populated versus unpopulated?
6795=                A.           I believe there was one that was populated,
6796=                and that would have been in Middle Tennessee, and two that
6797=                had zero population in the northeast portion of the state.
6798=                                   MR. TIFT:  And, at this point, we'd
6799=                like to use a demonstrative exhibit to use with the
6800=                witness concerning this map.  We're going to use the easel
6801=                here, if that's helpful.  And this is also at the very
6802=                back of the final binder under Tab 118 -- sorry.  Tab 170.
fmt=pb
6803=                We'll start three pages from the back.
6804=                BY MR. TIFT:
6805=                Q.           Dr. Cervas, looking to this demonstrative
6806=                exhibit before you, do you recognize this demonstrative
6807=                exhibit?
6808=                A.           I do.
6809=                Q.           And what is this exhibit reflecting?
6810=                A.           This is District 1 and District 3 in my
6811=                illustrative Map 13D_e.
6812=                Q.           Okay.  And there's two circled little spots
6813=                on here.  What do those represent?
6814=                A.           Those are the two noncontiguous census
6815=                blocks, the small geography area, that unfortunately crept
6816=                their way into this illustrative map.
6817=                Q.           When creating Map 13D_e, did you use the
6818=                non-contiguity tool on DRA, and were these identified?
6819=                A.           Yeah.  I tried to use that tool, but it
6820=                didn't identify any noncontiguous areas.
6821=                Q.           Okay.  And so what is the population of these
6822=                two non-contiguities?
6823=                A.           Both of these have no people in them at all.
6824=                                   MR. TIFT:  And I don't know if the
6825=                Court would give leave to the witness to approach this to
6826=                point to answer the question of what is involved in you
6827=                correcting these non-contiguities.
fmt=pb
6828=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  We'll give it a try.
6829=                                   MR. TIFT:  I would ask if you could
6830=                start at the top --
6831=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor --
6832=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  You've got freedom to
6833=                move around the courtroom, if you wish.
6834=                                   MR. SWATLEY:  Well, I would just object
6835=                to him insinuating to a map that's not in the record,
6836=                wasn't disclosed according to the Court's deadlines.  If
6837=                he's going to try to talk about a map that's not in the
6838=                record, some hypothetical corrected map that's not here,
6839=                our expert hasn't had a chance to analyze it, it wasn't
6840=                disclosed by the discovery deadline.
6841=                                   MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, this map is in
6842=                the record.  This is Map 13D_e.  Including these
6843=                non-contiguities.  And Dr. Cervas is about to show you, as
6844=                a task of redistricting, what's involved in pairing a
6845=                non-contiguity with its appropriate district.  It is not a
6846=                new map.  This is the map that we're discussing --
6847=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Objection overruled.
6848=                BY MR. TIFT:
6849=                Q.           Can you identify one of the two
6850=                non-contiguities here, and pointing to it, helping us see
6851=                where you are?
6852=                A.           So I used the dotted circle, dashed circle to
fmt=pb
6853=                identify where they are.
6854=                             Again, they're very, very, very, very, very
6855=                small.  And so it's right there.
6856=                Q.           Okay.  And which district is that census
6857=                block assigned to?
6858=                A.           It was, in this map, assigned to District 1.
6859=                Q.           And which district is it, sort of, surrounded
6860=                by?
6861=                A.           It should have been assigned to District 3.
6862=                Q.           And is this one or more census blocks?
6863=                A.           This is exactly one census block.
6864=                Q.           And how many people live in this census
6865=                block?
6866=                A.           Nobody.
6867=                Q.           Do you know if there's land in this census
6868=                block?
6869=                A.           You can see this, sort of, weird boundary.
6870=                This is actually a lake.
6871=                Q.           And so what's involved in pairing this with
6872=                its correct district?
6873=                A.           All one would need to do is to reassign this
6874=                one census block into District 3, and that noncontiguous
6875=                is gone.
6876=                Q.           Okay.  And then point us out the other -- the
6877=                noncontiguous census block in this map.
fmt=pb
6878=                A.           Again, it's almost -- you probably can't see
6879=                it at any distance.  I couldn't see it from over there.
6880=                             It's a little, tiny dot right there
6881=                (indicating).
6882=                Q.           Okay.  And which district was it assigned to?
6883=                A.           Also assigned to District 1.
6884=                Q.           And which district does it actually abut?
6885=                A.           It should have been in District Number 3.
6886=                Q.           So what's involved in correcting that
6887=                non-contiguity?
6888=                A.           Again, taking the spreadsheet with the
6889=                197,000 census blocks, you would have to identify that
6890=                number.  That's the unique identifier for the census
6891=                block.  And change it from 1 to 3.
6892=                Q.           Okay.  And would doing so change the variance
6893=                in this map at all?
6894=                A.           No.
6895=                Q.           Okay.  And why is that?
6896=                A.           Again, nobody lives in these.  So there's no
6897=                possible way to change the populations of the districts.
6898=                Q.           Okay.  Now, I'd direct you to the
6899=                next demonstrative -- which, in the binders, is the next
6900=                page.
6901=                             Can you identify the noncontiguous census
6902=                block in this demonstrative?
fmt=pb
6903=                A.           This one is right here (indicating).  It's in
6904=                Dickson County.
6905=                Q.           And how many people live in this census
6906=                block?
6907=                A.           There's 11 people who live in this one.
6908=                Q.           And which district is it assigned to in Map
6909=                13D_e?
6910=                A.           It's assigned to District 78 right here
6911=                (indicating).
6912=                Q.           And to correct the non-contiguity, which
6913=                district should it be assigned to?
6914=                A.           It should be assigned to District 69.
6915=                Q.           And what's involved in reassigning it to
6916=                District 69?
6917=                A.           Again, you simply just have to -- in the
6918=                software, you know, just literally click, and then
6919=                reassign it, or go into the spreadsheet and change the
6920=                number.
6921=                Q.           Okay.  And would doing so change the total
6922=                variance of this map?
6923=                A.           No.
6924=                Q.           And why is that?
6925=                A.           The total variance or overall variance, as
6926=                it's been called, and is in my report, its overall
6927=                variance is the largest district in the state and the
fmt=pb
6928=                smallest district in the state.  And that is neither of
6929=                these two districts.  And they're not anywhere close to
6930=                being the largest or smallest.  And, therefore, a small
6931=                change of just 11 people isn't going to affect the overall
6932=                variance.
6933=                Q.           Okay.  And so just to confirm, District 78
6934=                and 69, you said, are not either the top or the bottom
6935=                population-wise districts?
6936=                A.           That's right.
6937=                Q.           Okay.  Are you aware if -- how many people is
6938=                11, you know, percentage-wise for one of these districts?
6939=                A.           Oh, you test my math.
6940=                             So there's, approximately, 70,000 people in
6941=                each district.  So 11 out of 70,000 is 0.000-something.  A
6942=                very, very small percentage in total population.
6943=                Q.           But, again, even if it changes the variance
6944=                in District 78 and 69, do I understand you correctly that
6945=                it will not change the total variance?
6946=                A.           That's right.
6947=                Q.           Okay.  Now, is fixing these non-contiguities,
6948=                pairing them with the correct districts, something that is
6949=                easy for you to do?
6950=                A.           It's very, very simple to do once they're
6951=                identified.
6952=                Q.           And does doing so change the number of county
fmt=pb
6953=                splits in the Map 13D_e at all?
6954=                A.           No.  It's important to note -- and I didn't
6955=                visualize it here.
6956=                             But there's a county border here.  So this is
6957=                a split county.  And, therefore, you can put this into
6958=                District 69, and it doesn't affect the split total at all,
6959=                in any sense.
6960=                             And if I could add that if there was a
6961=                problem with the variance, you could simply reassign any
6962=                of the census blocks along this line without affecting the
6963=                splits in any way.
6964=                Q.           So would correcting these three noncontiguous
6965=                census blocks affect Map 13D_e's total variance at all?
6966=                A.           No, not at all.
6967=                Q.           Would doing so affect its number of county
6968=                splits at all?
6969=                A.           No, not at all.
6970=                Q.           And does -- do the presence of these three
6971=                non-contiguities in these maps in any way alter your
6972=                expert opinion in this case?
6973=                A.           No.  My expert report remains exactly as it
6974=                was, that the State could have reduced the total number of
6975=                county splits while adhering to all federal law.
6976=                                   MR. TIFT:  All right, Your Honor.  I
6977=                think that's what I was trying to figure out, if we had
fmt=pb
6978=                the time for.  So this could be a time to adjourn.  I can
6979=                certainly go back to where I was, and keep going also.
6980=                                   CHIEF JUDGE:  Let's adjourn for the
6981=                day.  Thank you.
