134=Michael Sharp, Judge; and Steven W. Maroney,
135=Chancellor, beginning at approximately 9:01 a.m.,
136=when the following proceedings were had, to-wit:)
137=
138=          MR. HART:  Your Honor, I apologize.  We
139=     had thought that our first witness, who is
140=     going to be taken out of turn, Mr. Sean Trende,
141=     would be here.  He was driving from Ohio last
142=     night and has gotten a little delayed.  We
143=     think he's on his way over here but is not here
144=     yet.  And I just wanted to inform the Court of
145=     that.  We do expect him to be here this
146=     morning.
147=          CHIEF JUDGE:  We would be happy to take
148=     him as soon as he gets here wherever we are in
149=     proceedings, so he can get back on the road.
150=          MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, just a little
151=     housekeeping measure we discussed with opposing
152=     counsel, one of our Plaintiffs, Mr. Wygant has
153=     an engagement in Gibson this evening and would
154=     like to drive back after lunch.  I understand
155=     Defendants are not going to re-call him.  They
fmt=pb
156=     are okay with him doing so as long as the Court
157=     is okay with him doing so.
158=          CHIEF JUDGE:  That would be fine.
159=          MR. TIFT:  Okay.  We are prepared for
160=     Mr. Cervas.
161=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Do you need a few minutes,
162=     Counsel?
163=          MR. TIFT:  I probably just need a few
164=     minutes to switch all the documents back.
165=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.  Take your time.
166=          MR. HART:  Your Honor, do you mind if I
167=     step out for a moment and try to call
168=     Mr. Trende.
169=          CHIEF JUDGE:  No.  Help yourself, sir.
170=          MR. HART:  Your Honor, he is on Highway

175=
176=DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. TIFT:
177=     Q    All right.  Good morning, Mr. Cervas.
178=     A    Good morning.
179=     Q    By way of quick reorientation, yesterday
180=we were on your first report which is tab, your
fmt=pb
181=first house report, which is Tab 8 in everyone's
182=binders, or I guess I should say Exhibit 8.  And
183=you'll recall, we had discussed 13a.  Then we had
184=been discussing 13b, which maybe you can help us
185=remember which page we need to look to to get back
186=to 13b.
187=     A    My illustrative plan start on Page 12 of
188=that first report under Tab 8, and my house plans
189=13a and 13b can be found on Page 13 and 14.
190=     Q    Okay.  And we had been discussing
191=noncontiguous census blocks yesterday.  And looking
192=back now to Cervas house map 13b, I believe we had
193=gotten to the point of Defense experts made you
194=aware of certain noncontiguous census blocks in 13b,
195=correct?
196=     A    That is correct.
197=     Q    And did those noncontiguous census blocks
198=have any population in them?
199=     A    No.  My recollection was that there was no
200=populations in any of those census blocks.
201=     Q    Okay.  And were you subsequently able to
202=pair those census blocks with their correct
203=contiguous districts?
204=     A    Yes.  I delivered a supplemental report
205=correcting those noncontiguous.  And I called the
fmt=pb
206=plans -- I consider these to be exactly the same
207=maps.  The only difference is that there are
208=technical corrections.  So 13b_e is a technical
209=correction.  It's the same plan.  No other changes
210=have been made in the plan at all, except to make
211=the technical changes.
212=     Q    And we looked yesterday at the rebuttal
213=report to note where you had put in links for 13b_e,
214=correct?
215=     A    Yes.  It was on a different exhibit
216=because it was a supplemental report after
217=Defendants experts pointed out these
218=technical errors.
219=     Q    Okay.  And so 13b_e what is the total
220=population variance on it?
221=     A    It would be identical to that of the 13b,
222=which can be found in Table 3 on Page 18.  And so
223=the total number of county splits in this table
224=listed TN county splits is 25.
225=     Q    So, that's the county splits.  I think I
226=asked what's the total variance.
227=     A    The total variance is 9.96.  And just
228=recalling the overall variance, you question keeps
229=referring to total variance.  Same terms, Courts
230=have used different terms all meaning exactly the
fmt=pb
231=same thing, the difference between the largest
232=district in the state and that was smallest district
233=in the state.  And that was 9.96 percent and that's
234=under the 10 percent threshold that the US Supreme
235=Court established.
236=     Q    Okay.  And you said the county splits in
237=this map 13b_e are 25?
238=     A    Yes.
239=     Q    And 13b_e is now fully contiguous?
240=     A    Would be identical with 25.
241=     Q    But is it now a contiguous map?
242=     A    Yes.  And I don't believe that Defendants
243=ever rebutted that fact, that those maps, the _e
244=maps are contiguous and therefore constitutional.
245=          MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, objection.  It's
246=     a legal conclusion.
247=          CHIEF JUDGE:  The Court will disregard the
248=     part about "and therefore constitutional."
249=     Q    (By Mr. Tift) In this map 13b and 13b_e,
250=did you make any effort to not pair incumbents?
251=     A    In this map, no.  Recalling that at the
252=time of this report, I was not provided data on
253=where the incumbents lived at the time of this
254=report.
255=     Q    All right.  And now we can turn to
fmt=pb
256=Tab/Exhibit 9, which is your December 2022 rebuttal
257=report.
258=     A    Yes, sir.
259=     Q    Now, Exhibit 9 includes Cervas map 13c on
260=Page 3.  Are you able to find that?
261=     A    The figures on Page 3, yes.
262=     Q    Okay.  And can you explain to us how you
263=got from 13b to 13c?
264=     A    So again, recalling that when I named the
265=map 13, it is indicating that Shelby County has 13
266=districts, and the boundary of Shelby County is --
267=all the districts are wholly within Shelby County.
268=And so, this continues that same objective of
269=keeping 13 districts in Shelby.
270=               But the expert witnesses for the
271=Defendants had pointed out that they believe that
272=the way I had paired my District 80 from 13b with
273=the adjacent Madison County violated the law
274=according to one of the Lockert cases, because there
275=was not one whole district fully inside of Madison.
276=               And I talk about that in this report.
277=I did not offer legal conclusions in my report.  I'm
278=not an attorney myself.  I did not graduate law
279=school.  My reading of the Constitution suggests
280=that the way I had done this is allowable under
fmt=pb
281=Tennessee Law.
282=          MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, objection.
283=     That's a legal conclusion.  He just stated he's
284=     not a lawyer.
285=          CHIEF JUDGE:  He's saying that this
286=     suggests, that goes back to what he is opining
287=     about.  We are not taking any of the experts'
288=     legal conclusions, to the extent they are legal
289=     conclusions, as evidence for us.  We are not
290=     bound by that.  We are going to have to make
291=     our own independent determination.  So, we are
292=     viewing it in that lens, but you are correct to
293=     protect your record.
294=          THE WITNESS:  So, 13b has District 80,
295=     which is a district that we believe is required
296=     by the Voting Rights Act in a way that doesn't
297=     leave enough population in Madison County for
298=     it to have its own district, so it needed to be
299=     combined with another county.  I combined it
300=     with another full county so there's no
301=     additional county split.  In fact, it reduces
302=     the amount of county splits found in the
303=     enacted plan in doing so.
304=          That said, in map 13c the Plaintiffs'
305=     counsel asked if I could create a map where I
fmt=pb
306=     do District 80 identical to the enacted map.
307=     And that means that District 80 and the
308=     adjacent, I believe, District 73 would be
309=     identical as the enacted map.  And then see if
310=     under that criteria if I could still
311=     significantly reduce the number of overall
312=     splits.
313=          So in other words, to take away the
314=     justification of additional county splits for
315=     the VRA district.  So, this map contains that
316=     VRA district plus all the other 12 districts in
317=     the state identical to the way the state drew
318=     them.
319=     Q    (By Mr. Tift) And can you remind us, you
320=are using a shorthand of VRA district when you are
321=talking about District 80.  Can you remind us what
322=that means to you?
323=     A    Right.  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 says
324=in Section II that you can't dilute the votes of a
325=protected minority group and --
326=          MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, objection to the
327=     extent he's interpreting law and making a legal
328=     conclusion.  Again, just for the record.
329=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.  And we're
330=     listening for his opinion, and we're going to
fmt=pb
331=     make an independent determination about the
332=     Constitution.
333=          MR. TIFT:  And I would say Plaintiffs are
334=     fine with considering that a standing objection
335=     if Mr. Swatley doesn't want to make it every
336=     time a question is asked.
337=          MR. SWATLEY:  I'm happy to make that
338=     standing objection if the Court is okay with
339=     that.
340=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Let the record so reflect.
341=          THE WITNESS:  And so, Section II of the
342=     Voting Rights Act requires that we don't dilute
343=     the votes of a protected minority.  And I
344=     believe just from my expertise that this
345=     particular region and based on previous court
346=     cases that this area of the state would be
347=     protected by Section II of the Voting Rights
348=     Act.  And therefore, the state has an
349=     obligation to comply with that.
350=          Though, I do believe that my map 13b is
351=     consistent with the Voting Rights Act, both in
352=     the spirit of the Voting Rights Act and in the
353=     process by which a redistricter were to go
354=     about by drawing it without race as a
355=     predominating motive, but drawing it in a way
fmt=pb
356=     that still satisfies the non-diluted properties
357=     of the Voting Rights Act.  If there was a
358=     compelling reason to draw the district
359=     identical to the way that the state does, this
360=     map does that.  It satisfies exactly the same
361=     criteria the state used.
362=     Q    Let me ask, is District 80 in the enacted
363=house map a majority-minority district?
364=     A    Yes.  It's a majority black voting-age
365=population district.  It's right around 57 percent
366=black voting-age population.
367=     Q    And is District 80 in 13b and 13b_e a
368=majority-minority district?
369=     A    It is.  It's over 50 percent plus one
370=black.
371=     Q    And is District 80 in Cervas house map 13c
372=a majority-minority district?
373=     A    It's identical to the enacted map and
374=therefore, it has the exact same properties as the
375=enacted map.
376=     Q    And we have District 80 and you have
377=mentioned the other district in Madison.  Throughout
378=your maps, does the other Madison County district
379=have a consistent number?
380=     A    Yes.  I see it right here, District 73.
fmt=pb
381=     Q    So is it accurate to say the districts you
382=are talking about here are 80 and 73?
383=     A    Yes.
384=     Q    And in 13b and 13b_e did the way that you
385=drew District 80 leave enough space in Madison
386=County for a full additional district within Madison
387=County?
388=     A    Yeah.  In map 13b, and it's technical
389=corrected that 13b_e, there would not have been
390=enough population left in Madison County for its own
391=district.  So it would need to be paired with
392=another district, though, not creating any
393=additional splits.
394=     Q    So did your District 80 in maps 13b and
395=13b_e lead to the need to combine the rest of
396=Madison County with an additional county or more?
397=     A    Does my drawing of District 80 lead to the
398=necessity of including the population
399=[unintelligible] of Madison County with the
400=subsequent adjacent county?  Yes.
401=     Q    And again, did you create the District 80
402=in reliance on federal law or state law?
403=     A    District 80 would be by the Voting Rights
404=Act, which is federal law superseding that of
405=Tennessee Law.
fmt=pb
406=     Q    All right.  So looking to map 13c and
407=using the actual district numbers this time, so are
408=Districts 80 and 73 in map 13c exactly the same as
409=they are in the enacted house map.
410=     A    They are.
411=     Q    All right.  You have spoken about
412=maintaining Districts 80 and 73 from the enacted
413=house map in 13c.  Did 13c have any other changes?
414=     A    Yes.  So, because you are changing
415=District 80, you have to change all the districts
416=surrounding it because it affects the different
417=counties.  Like almost every decision in
418=redistricting, when you change one line, you end up
419=having this ripple effect that goes pretty
420=significantly far.
421=               And I was tasked with trying to keep
422=the number of county splits to a low level, and to
423=do that, because District 80 itself is creating
424=three county splits, I had to add county splits to
425=re-create the enacted plan.  So I had to find
426=somewhere else in the map to reduce it back down.
427=So there is changes in, I believe, over 20 of the 40
428=districts that are not identical to the enacted map.
429=               It caused a lot of changes throughout
430=this map, though not anything that should be
fmt=pb
431=regarded as substantial, because the Voting Rights
432=Act districts are not changing.  It's just which
433=counties go with what to create the other districts
434=in the state.
435=     Q    So overall how many majority-minority
436=districts are in map 13c?
437=     A    13c will have identical 13
438=majority-minority districts.  All of them identical
439=in shape and in demographics identical to the
440=enacted plan.
441=     Q    And how many county splits are in map 13c?
442=     A    You can see the date in Table 1 on Page 5
443=of this report, and here I show there are 24 county
444=splits in map 13c.
445=     Q    Okay.  And what's the total or overall
446=population deviation for map 13c?
447=     A    It's still 9.96.  Quite high, again,
448=because recalling yesterday's testimony, because
449=there are districts in the enacted map that have
450=very high deviations.  And they are not affected by
451=my map.  So those high deviations continue to
452=persist in my map.
453=               That includes -- there are three
454=districts in Montgomery County.  And they all have
455=5.09 percent, too many people by 5 percent in all
fmt=pb
456=three of those districts.  Because I perpetuated
457=those districts in these maps the deviations are
458=still really high.  Unless I were to do something
459=about that and alleviate the population there, we'll
460=continue to have those very high population
461=deviations.
462=     Q    And you say "very high."  How does the
463=9.96 compare to the enacted house map's total
464=deviation?
465=     A    It's high in a sense that it's very close
466=to the 10 percent threshold.  But the enacted map
467=itself is at 9.9 percent, and this is 9.96, so it's
468=.06 percent more, which is to say not very much
469=more.  But it's still high and there are ways to
470=reduce the total population deviation if one chooses
471=to.  And if you just look over, like your eyes, just
472=slightly to the right here, you will see that 13d
473=has a 9.89 percent deviation.  So there are
474=potential ways of alleviating the total deviation.
475=               But in this map, almost all of the
476=legislature's choices are maintained.  In only very
477=few, the additional splits that are added to this
478=map are eliminated to reduce the total number of
479=county splits.
480=     Q    In map 13c, did you make any effort to
fmt=pb
481=avoid pairing incumbents?
482=     A    In map 13c, no.  The only thing I was
483=attempting to do in map 13c was to make District 80
484=identical to the enacted plan.  And I had no other
485=objectives in that plan, other than to continue to
486=maintain a low number of county splits throughout
487=the state because that's what the Tennessee
488=Constitution says.
489=     Q    And similar question in map 13c, did you
490=make any effort to change the core preservation as
491=compared to your previous maps?
492=     A    No.  Again, the only objective of map 13c
493=was to fix the District 80 to be identical to the
494=enacted map and to continue to lower the number of
495=county splits, no other objectives.
496=     Q    Okay.  Now, at some point did you become
497=aware of any noncontiguous census blocks in map 13c?
498=     A    No.
499=     Q    And are you aware of any noncontiguous
500=census blocks in map 13c to this day?
501=     A    I have not been able to identify any and
502=nobody else has identified any non contiguities in
503=map 13c.
504=     Q    Two pages over we see your illustration
505=for map 13d on Page 5 of your rebuttal report.  Have
fmt=pb
506=you been able to find that?
507=     A    Yes.
508=     Q    Okay.  Now explain to us how you got from
509=map 13c to map 13d?
510=     A    So, Defendants' experts had criticized map
511=13b and the other maps that I had provided as
512=illustrative, because they failed to retain the
513=cores of the prior districts and that they paired
514=too many incumbents.  And so map 13d was a response
515=to those criticisms.
516=     Q    Okay.  And so, that being a response to
517=those criticisms, what did you do to respond to
518=those criticisms?
519=     A    So at this point, I was provided
520=confidentially the incumbents' addresses for all
521=members.  I don't know anything about the actual
522=data, other than that's the data that was provided
523=to me by the Defendants for me to unpair the
524=incumbents.
525=               So, now that I have that data, I
526=could draw a map that did exactly as I've said, kept
527=Shelby County and Davidson County and Knox County
528=and Hamilton County, all those urban counties,
529=District 80 and 73, and various other districts in
530=the state identical to the enacted map.  But now
fmt=pb
531=unpair incumbents anywhere I could to reduce the
532=number of what Mr. Trende called double bunks, so I
533=used his term here in the report.  You might call it
534=a paired incumbent, so that two incumbents didn't
535=have to face each other in the next election.
536=               And I also did as much as I could to
537=retain the cores of the prior districts.  And that
538=was defined by the Defendants' experts as the cores
539=of the 2012 enacted map.  And so the numbers
540=reflected in Table 1 under 13d, the very last
541=column, shows that there is 80.1 percent of the
542=cores are retained.  That means that 80 percent of
543=the districts are unchanged from 2012.  That number,
544=I believe, either matches or exceeds the number in
545=the enacted map.
546=               And you also see in the very last row
547=of that that, there are only six double bunks.  And
548=you can compare that to the first column.  I see now
549=I have the enacted plan listed.  Those numbers are
550=identical to the enacted plan.
551=               So reading through the table, you can
552=see that 13d has a lower overall deviation, because
553=in 13d -- well, I'm not exactly sure how the
554=deviation goes down.  I don't want to speak to that
555=right now, because I don't have more data in front
fmt=pb
556=of me.  But the total deviation is lower than the
557=enacted map.  The average deviation is lower than
558=the enacted map.
559=               The compactness scores are
560=equivalent.  I believe they are both higher.  Which
561=on compactness, higher is better.  Core retention is
562=identical and double bunks is identical.  So 13d is
563=in every way either identical or superior to the
564=enacted map, particularly on the county splits
565=measure, which went from 30 to 24.
566=     Q    Okay.  And you have just walked us through
567=this chart.  We are looking at Exhibit 5.  I do want
568=to focus specifically just to make sure that we have
569=talked it through.  You have said that your
570=objective here was to work on core retention and
571=double bunking.  On the metric of core retention,
572=how does 13d compare to the enacted house map?
573=     A    They both score 80.1 percent identical.
574=     Q    And I know it's listed double bunks here.
575=Am I accurate if I also call that incumbent
576=pairings?
577=     A    Yes.
578=     Q    On the metric of double bunks or incumbent
579=pairings how does, how does 13d compare to the
580=enacted house map?
fmt=pb
581=     A    They both have exactly six.
582=     Q    And on the question of overall deviation
583=how does the enacted map compare to 13d?
584=     A    The enacted map has a 9.90 percent overall
585=deviation, and 13d has a 9.89 percent overall
586=deviation.
587=     Q    So 13d's deviation is somewhat lower,
588=correct?
589=     A    Yes.
590=     Q    And it's not on this summary chart, but
591=how did the majority-minority districts compare
592=between the enacted house map and 13d?
593=     A    This is a series 13 map if you will, so
594=the majority-minority districts are identical,
595=including District 80, absolutely identical to the
596=enacted map.
597=     Q    Okay.  And in addition how did the county
598=splits compare between 13d and the enacted house
599=map?
600=     A    In the enacted house map, there are 30
601=county splits.  In 13d, there are 24, six less than
602=the enacted map.
603=     Q    Looking back to the second page of your
604=rebuttal report, in your first bolded point you
605=address noncontiguous census blocks.  What are you
fmt=pb
606=explaining in this section of your report?
607=     A    This is the section where I thank
608=Mr. Himes for identifying the zero population non
609=contiguities that were in maps 13b, 14a, 13.5a, and
610=13.5b.  And I'm acknowledging that those were
611=technical errors that had no effect on the plans and
612=that I have made those corrections, which the links
613=are found later in this report.
614=     Q    Those links are found on Page 5 in the
615=footnotes, correct?
616=     A    That's right.  Footnotes 9 through 12 have
617=those corrections.
618=     Q    Okay.  And then, you are also reporting
619=something here in point two about map 13a.  Can you
620=explain what point you are making about 13a here?
621=     A    In case it wasn't clear from my prior
622=report, I did not think that map 13a was one that
623=was viable because of the potential violation of the
624=Voting Rights Act in District 80.  So I was
625=reiterating that that was the first map I drew.  It
626=was the baseline by which the other ones came about
627=but that it was not a viable map.
628=     Q    Okay.  And then, on Page 4 your ninth
629=point, you address core retention and incumbency
630=protection.  Have we pretty much covered the core
fmt=pb
631=retention and incumbency protection opinions in your
632=previous testimony?
633=     A    If I could just add that, like, reading
634=through the Tennessee Constitution and certainly in
635=the US Constitution and in federal statute, there
636=are absolutely no mentions of core retention or
637=incumbency protection.  And in the guidance provided
638=by the state house redistricting subcommittee
639=document that I used as my guidelines, these were
640=not mentioned.  These two, core retention and
641=incumbent pairings were not mentioned as criteria.
642=     Q    Okay.  And did anything in the Defendants'
643=experts' witnesses reports, upon your receiving
644=them, change your opinion in this case concerning
645=whether fewer counties could have been split while
646=still complying with the federal constitutional
647=requirements on the 2020 census data?
648=     A    No.  My opinion remains unequivocal that
649=the legislature could have enacted a plan with far
650=fewer splits.  And I think that the preponderance of
651=evidence that I have given here shows that that's
652=absolutely 100 percent true.
653=     Q    And do you submit for the Court that your
654=opinions in your rebuttal report that we just looked
655=at also support your just stated opinion?
fmt=pb
656=     A    It actually furthers my confidence in this
657=matter that even holding almost every one of the
658=State's legitimate state interest, including things
659=that are not found in the Constitution, like core
660=retention and incumbent protection, they still could
661=have reduced the number of county splits in this
662=plan and they failed to do so.
663=     Q    And in your 13d, how many fewer county
664=splits could they have enacted while still meeting
665=all those metrics?
666=     A    A total of six counties could have been
667=not split while holding everything else constant.
668=     Q    And in that map, would the variance have
669=been the same or better?
670=     A    It would have been better.
671=     Q    All right.  Let's turn now to Exhibit 10.
672=          MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, I would just
673=     like to go ahead and object.  This is the
674=     supplemental report we contend was submitted
675=     late after the closing of discovery according
676=     to the Discovery Order.  I realize the Motion
677=     in Limine was ruled on.  I just want to
678=     preserve the objection.
679=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.  Noted.
680=     Objection overruled.
fmt=pb
681=          MR. TIFT:  And Plaintiffs are similarly
682=     fine with the standing objection on that point
683=     and even believe that a denied Motion in Limine
684=     does preserve that objection throughout the
685=     trial.  But we are fine with considering that a
686=     standing objection.
687=     Q    (By Mr. Tift) Okay.  I have just directed
688=you to Exhibit 10.  Do you recognize this as a
689=response authored by you to the Defendant expert
690=depositions?
691=     A    Yes, this is dated January 9, 2023.
692=     Q    And what was your reason for generating
693=this report?
694=     A    There were two issues that Defendants'
695=experts pointed out in their depositions.
696=     Q    If I can interrupt you for a second, did
697=their depositions take place after the report we
698=just looked at or before it?
699=     A    It was after that report, because they
700=were now responding to that report.  So this report
701=is just a response to their criticisms of my prior
702=report.
703=     Q    Were they criticisms related to one
704=specific map from your rebuttal report?
705=     A    Yes.  Because 13c had no noncontiguous
fmt=pb
706=districts, and so otherwise, they had nothing to say
707=on that map.
708=     Q    So does this response only concern
709=revisions to your map 13d?
710=     A    That is correct.
711=     Q    And what two criticisms did Defendants'
712=experts raise in their depositions concerning map
713=13d?
714=     A    They raised a concern about noncontiguous
715=census block.  And though I write in here that there
716=was a single one, I actually now believe that there
717=were two.  We showed yesterday on the giant exhibits
718=that there was another one in the map that we are
719=now going to talk about.  I believe that probably
720=was also existing in the other one but I did not
721=catch it.  So it continued on in the next iteration.
722=So there's this single, noncontiguous block that I
723=was able to identify in 13d.
724=               But they also claim that I had
725=improperly, quote, double split Sullivan County,
726=which is the county that is the very far northeast
727=of the state on the North Carolina border.
728=     Q    All right.  Let's talk about that double
729=split first, and I believe you have got some
730=illustrations that might assist you in talking about
fmt=pb
731=that.  But can you address the double split and what
732=you did in 13d_e concerning that?
733=     A    So, reminding you that the task was to
734=retain as much of the cores as possible in this 13d
735=map, this particular area of the state has lost
736=population.  So the Districts 1, 2, and 3, which are
737=the districts as they are numbered in this part of
738=the state, had to expand.  They had to include more
739=population, which meant having to over into the
740=Hawkins County creating an extra split but by
741=necessity.  No matter how you draw these plans
742=there's going to be a forced split here.
743=               The question is which district gets
744=split?  Instead of having District 3 go through four
745=different counties the way the state legislature had
746=done, I had it go through only three counties and
747=had District 2 span two counties.
748=               Again, the configurations can be done
749=kind of any way you want.  They are three districts
750=that are all contained in the same population block.
751=And because the goal of that map was to retain the
752=cores, I matched it up as closely as possible to the
753=2012 map and retained the most amount of cores
754=possible.  And the way that worked out was to create
755=what they call a double split.
fmt=pb
756=               I personally, as a mapmaker, find it
757=to be a better way of mapping, the way I had done it
758=in my 13d, and I stand by that as a legitimate
759=decision.  Because a county instead of going on kind
760=of aimlessly into multiple counties gets more
761=limited, and then you have a much more compact
762=second district, so it really increases compactness
763=a lot.  And it also had the virtue of increasing
764=core retention.
765=               So in map 13d_e this is a correction
766=to both the noncontiguous zero population census
767=blocks and to configure this Districts 1, 2, and 3
768=much more closely to the enacted plan.
769=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Just for the record, I
770=     believe the expert stuck his head in the
771=     courtroom.
772=          MR. HART:  May I go check?
773=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Yes.
774=          MR. TIFT:  And I believe we could finish
775=     addressing this double split and then be at a
776=     good point if he is ready.  Is counsel okay if
777=     I do that while Mr. Hart has stepped outside or
778=     should we wait a second?
779=          MR. RIEGER:  Let's wait a second until Mr.
780=     Hart has had an opportunity to chat.
fmt=pb
781=          MR. TIFT:  Okay.
782=                    [Respite.]
783=     Q    (By Mr. Tift) Okay.  So we have been
784=looking at these Pages 2 and 3 illustration showing
785=the different Sullivan, Hawkins, Carter, Johnson
786=Counties, and you were explaining what the double
787=split was in your map.  Do you see in the map you
788=created, 13d, what Defendants refer to as a double
789=split?
790=     A    Yes.  So now we are looking at Page 3, so
791=it would be Figure 3 on Page 3 zoomed in on those
792=Districts 1, 2, and 3.  And you can see that
793=District 2 is part Sullivan County and part Hawkins
794=County.  And District 1 is fully contained in
795=Sullivan County.  And District 3 is just the part of
796=Carter, all of Johnson, and all of Sullivan.
797=     Q    And what did you do to address this
798=criticism?
799=     A    So, you will see in Figure 4, District 2
800=now is all within Sullivan County, as is District 1.
801=And District 3 now spans those four counties.  And
802=you'll also notice that the shape of 13d_e of
803=District 3 is much more bizarre and much less
804=compact.  So they both are legitimate ways of
805=configuring these districts.  My 13d is more compact
fmt=pb
806=and preferable to me as a mapmaker, but you can see
807=that the districts are all contained in the same
808=counties.  There's the same exact number of county
809=splits.
810=               However one configures these
811=districts has no effect on the number of county
812=splits in the map or any of the other.  Variation is
813=shared between these, so you can adjust the
814=boundaries to create low population deviations as
815=possible between these districts.  So there's no
816=meaningful difference between any of these maps on
817=the measures that matter here.
818=     Q    Okay.  So did your revision from 13d to
819=13d_e remove the double split that was pointed out
820=by Defendants' experts?
821=     A    Yes, it's now removed.  So Districts 1 and
822=2 are completely and wholly contained within
823=Sullivan County, and there's no double split.
824=          MR. TIFT:  Okay.  We would suggest pausing
825=     Dr. Cervas at this point for Mr. Trende to
826=     proffer his testimony.
827=          CHIEF JUDGE:  That works for the Court.
828=     We're going to take about five minutes.

844=the Court, please.
845=     A    Sean Patrick Trende.
846=     Q    And, Mr. Trende, what is your current
847=employment?
848=     A    I'm the senior elections analyst for
849=RealClearPolitics.  I'm also finishing up my PhD at
850=the Ohio State University.
851=     Q    And I have handed you what's in the
852=binders as Exhibit No. 16.  And is that the expert
853=report that you prepared in this case?
854=     A    Yes, sir.
855=     Q    And when was this report prepared?
856=     A    This report was prepared in the second
fmt=pb
857=half of 2022.  I'm not sure about the exact date.
858=     Q    And who prepared the report?
859=     A    I did.
860=     Q    And refer you to the last pages labeled
861=Appendix A is that your curriculum vitae as of
862=November 2021?
863=     A    Yes, it is.
864=     Q    And is that correct and accurate as of
865=that date?
866=     A    Yes, it is.
867=     Q    Are there any significant changes that
868=have occurred to your CV?
869=     A    The PhD should be expected 2023.  That's a
870=typo.  And that's still the expectation.  Other than
871=that, no, there's no significant updates.
872=     Q    Does Page 1 of your CV accurately set
873=forth your formal education?
874=     A    Yes, it does.
875=     Q    And would you just summarize your
876=education.
877=     A    Yes.  So I graduated from Yale with a
878=degree in history and political science in 1995.  In
879=2001, I went to law school at Duke University.  And
880=at the time Duke offered a program where you could
881=get a joint degree with one of their other schools,
fmt=pb
882=so I opted to get a Masters degree in political
883=science at the same time.  And I was awarded both in
884=2001.
885=               In 2016, I started to earn my PhD at
886=Ohio State in political science.  And when I showed
887=up, they looked at my experience with my Masters
888=degree and suggested that rather than go through
889=their quantitative method sequence that I go over to
890=the statistics department and take my quantitative
891=methods there.  So I earned a Masters degree in
892=applied statistics, which was awarded in 2019.
893=               And I have turned in a complete
894=version of my dissertation and expect to be awarded
895=that degree at the conclusion of the summer term.
896=     Q    And will you tell the Panel just briefly
897=how does that coursework and your education relate
898=the redistricting issues?
899=     A    So one of the chapters in my dissertation
900=has to do with application of communities of
901=interest to redistricting simulations, so it
902=involves a pretty deep dive into redistricting
903=methods.  I also took coursework in geographic
904=information systems programs, which is where you
905=learn about shapefiles and all the building blocks
906=of redistricting.  And I also did an independent
fmt=pb
907=study in preparation for my dissertation chapter on
908=the redistricting literature.
909=     Q    And refer you to Page 2 of your CV it
910=lists previous expert testimony in over 20 matters;
911=is that correct?
912=     A    That is correct.
913=     Q    And will you just summarize your
914=experience testifying as an expert witness?
915=     A    So, I have testified in a variety of
916=contexts.  But in the political and racial
917=gerrymandering context, I testified in the Whitford
918=v. Nichol case, as well as the Rucho v. Common
919=Cause, which are the two that went up to the Supreme
920=Court of the United States.  I also have testified
921=in a variety of cases this semester -- or this
922=semester, this cycle.
923=               Every blurs together, Your Honor.
924=               The most prominent of which were
925=probably the Maryland case, where that map was
926=struck down as a political gerrymander in reliance
927=on my testimony.  And then the Harkenrider v. Hochul
928=case, where the three New York Courts struck down
929=that map as a political gerrymander.
930=     Q    And can you just briefly summarize how
931=your previous expert testimony and work relates to
fmt=pb
932=the issues in this lawsuit that you are being asked
933=to be an expert on?
934=     A    So, in all those cases, particularly the
935=Maryland case, we focused on issues that are
936=relevant to this case:  County splits, compactness
937=measures.  You know, there are additional issues
938=including various criteria for determining whether a
939=map is a political gerrymander, which I understand
940=are not raised in this matter, but the core matters
941=of looking to see if incumbents are paired, looking
942=to see if counties are cracked is included there.
943=               I also testified in NAACP v. McMaster
944=and have pending testimony in the Texas racial
945=gerrymandering/VRA case.  So I have experience there
946=with some of the, I guess, side matters raised by
947=this litigation.
948=     Q    Page 3 of your CV lists court
949=appointments.  Can you tell us about these court
950=appointments and how they relate to redistricting
951=issues.
952=     A    So the first court appointment issue was
953=actually the Supreme Court of Belize appointed me as
954=special master for the Court in their version of
955=Baker v. Carr.  So I was tasked with the Court of
956=summarizing international standards of fairness and
fmt=pb
957=redistricting for them and then was asked to prepare
958=alternative maps that would comply with
959=international standards of fairness similar to our
960=VRA Gingles step one, just to offer proof of concept
961=that you can, in fact, do this in their country.
962=               From there, I was appointed as a
963=Voting Rights Act expert by the Arizona Independent
964=Redistricting Commission.  I was counsel to counsel,
965=I suppose.  The lawyers that were advising the
966=Independent Redistricting Commission relied on my
967=advice and Professor Ansolabehere at Harvard
968=University on whether the maps that were being
969=complied with the Voting Rights Act.
970=               And then, I was appointed, along with
971=Bernie Grofman as special master by the expert
972=report of Virginia when their Independent
973=Redistricting Commission deadlocked to draw the maps
974=for them.  So, Dr. Grofman and I drew the
975=congressional state senate and state house maps.
976=               And pretty proud that the two states
977=I worked on were about the only swingish state maps
978=that didn't get challenged so far this cycle.
979=     Q    And when you were appointed special master
980=in the Virginia matter, did you draw any maps in
981=that case?
fmt=pb
982=     A    So, Dr. Grofman and I, we collaborated on
983=every map that was drawn, but we drew the
984=congressional state senate and state House of
985=Representative maps.
986=     Q    Do you know if Dr. Cervas drew any maps in
987=that case?
988=     A    I don't believe he did.
989=     Q    In addition to your expert testimony you
990=provided in numerous matters and court appointments
991=regarding redistricting, will you briefly summarize
992=your teaching experience and experience with
993=publications and presentations that would be
994=relevant regarding redistricting?
995=     A    So I have been teaching for the past five
996=years as part of my grad school.  This one was not
997=related to my grad school, but I was appointed
998=lecturer at Ohio Wesleyan University to teach
999=American Democracy and Mass Media.  But after that
1000=at Ohio State, I taught the Intro American Politics
1001=class in, I guess, four semesters.  That class
1002=touches briefly on redistricting as part of
1003=explaining how congressional districts are drawn.
1004=               The more in-depth work is a class
1005=that I have kind of put together, and I'm teaching
1006=it this semester, as well, and that's Political
fmt=pb
1007=Participation and Voting Behavior.  And so the first
1008=half of that class is designed as like a theory
1009=section:  What motivates people to vote, how do
1010=people make their choices when they go into the
1011=voting booths, how do campaigns interact with
1012=people's decisions on how they are going to vote.
1013=               The second half is an application.
1014=So we take the theory that we learned in the first
1015=half and look at real world problems.  And one of
1016=the real world problems that we spend a lot of time
1017=on is political gerrymandering.
1018=               We probably spend two weeks on racial
1019=gerrymandering and the Voting Rights Act and then
1020=three weeks on political gerrymandering, looking at
1021=how courts have dealt with these issues, what
1022=political scientists have suggested as metrics.  We
1023=go through in detail how you calculate the various
1024=compactness metrics and go through traditional
1025=redistricting criteria and how political scientists
1026=have suggested those criteria be dealt with.
1027=               And then, I'm pretty excited for
1028=Friday.  Their final project is to actually draw a
1029=map and present it to the class trying to comply
1030=with one of the variance suggestions political
1031=scientists have made.  So, I'm looking forward to
fmt=pb
1032=seeing what they come up.
1033=     Q    Very good.  Thank you.  And in addition to
1034=the Appendix A, the CV, does your report correctly
1035=list your background in terms of education,
1036=professional experience, publications, court
1037=appointments, expert testimony on Pages 1 through 5
1038=of your expert report?
1039=     A    Yes, sir.
1040=          MR. HART:  I move the Panel find that
1041=     Mr. Trende is qualified as an expert regarding
1042=     redistrict mapping and use of tools to do that
1043=     mapping, map evaluations, redistricting
1044=     criteria, and related redistricting issues by
1045=     virtue of his knowledge, skill, experience,
1046=     training, and education so that he could
1047=     testify in the form of an opinion in regard to
1048=     these redistricting related issues.
1049=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Any objection?
1050=          MR. GARRISON:  No objection, Your Honor.
1051=          CHIEF JUDGE:  He will be recognized as an
1052=     expert and allowed to testify as such.
1053=          MR. HART:  Thank you.
1054=     Q    (By Mr. Hart) And in this case you were
1055=retained by the Tennessee Attorney General's Office
1056=on behalf of the Defendants, correct?
fmt=pb
1057=     A    That is correct.
1058=     Q    And what was the scope of your engagement?
1059=     A    So, I was asked to evaluate the Tennessee
1060=maps passed in response to the 2020 census.  Then, I
1061=was also asked to review the maps that were
1062=presented by Dr. Cervas in his initial report.
1063=     Q    And you weren't asked to generate any maps
1064=of your own in this case, were you?
1065=     A    No, I was not.
1066=     Q    Does Page 6 and 7 of you're expert report,
1067=Exhibit 16, correctly reflect the scope of your
1068=engagement?
1069=     A    Yes, it does.
1070=     Q    Referring to Exhibit 16, Part 3 on Page 7,
1071=does that provide an accurate summary of your
1072=opinions as of the data of this report?
1073=     A    Yes, it does.
1074=     Q    And are those your opinions to a
1075=reasonable degree of professional certainty?
1076=     A    Yes, they are.
1077=     Q    And who developed these opinions, whose
1078=opinions are these?
1079=     A    These are my opinions.
1080=     Q    Whose analysis were these opinions based
1081=upon?
fmt=pb
1082=     A    The analysis was performed solely by
1083=myself.
1084=     Q    Would you just give us a summary of your
1085=opinions as you set forth in the report?
1086=     A    So again, this is responding to the
1087=initial maps that were drawn in Dr. Cervas' first
1088=report, and I had five opinions:
1089=               The first was that his maps forced
1090=the legislature, as I put it, play chicken with the
1091=VRA by dismantling a likely ability to elect
1092=district in South Central Tennessee.
1093=               I also noted that there were
1094=difficulties in the Madison County area, because
1095=they predict that all of them except for 13a failed
1096=to create a district that was contained wholly
1097=within Madison County, when such a district could
1098=have been drawn.
1099=               I noted that final two maps traversed
1100=a county boundary without offering justification for
1101=doing so.
1102=               Then, I looked through his maps to
1103=look at core retention and pairing of incumbents.
1104=And I think the best way to put it is they had low
1105=rates of core retention and they paired a huge
1106=number of incumbents together.
fmt=pb
1107=               So, because of this, at least as of
1108=the end of the first report, there was no
1109=demonstration that you could create legal districts
1110=that could pass the legislature and withstand VRA
1111=scrutiny.
1112=     Q    Okay.  Let me take you back to the first
1113=point you talked about, which the maps would have
1114=the state play chicken with the VRA.  What do you
1115=mean by that and why is that important, if it is
1116=important?
1117=     A    Well, because the legislature has to try
1118=to comply with the Federal Constitution and federal
1119=law, which requires you to draw ability to elect
1120=districts where the minority group can elect its
1121=candidates of choice in certain circumstances.  When
1122=you have a performing district that's consistently
1123=elected a black candidate of choice, dismantling
1124=that district is something the legislature is going
1125=to want to avoid, both for legal reasons and for
1126=just the optics of doing so.
1127=     Q    You talked about the maps creating
1128=difficulties in the Madison County area.  Will you
1129=explain that a little bit more?
1130=     A    So that is the issue that most of the maps
1131=don't create a district wholly within Madison County
fmt=pb
1132=when you can do so.
1133=     Q    Does your report at Page 7 contain an
1134=accurate summary of your opinions?
1135=     A    It does.
1136=     Q    For purposes of preparing your report, and
1137=I'll refer you to Page 8 of your expert report,
1138=Exhibit No. 16, what data did you review and rely
1139=upon?
1140=     A    So, Dr. Cervas provided links to his maps
1141=that he had drawn in Dave's Redistricting App.  So
1142=I, of course, relied upon those and seen what he had
1143=drawn.
1144=               I also downloaded Tennessee political
1145=materials for the block precinct and county level
1146=from the redistricting data hub, which is kind of a
1147=consortium of redistricting experts pool data, so
1148=it's relied upon by experts in litigation routinely.
1149=That was for conducting my own analyses of his maps.
1150=               And then, I did review the Supreme
1151=Court of Tennessee's three opinions in the Lockert
1152=series of cases.  So, those were the main things
1153=upon which I relied.
1154=     Q    And in this case, Dr. Cervas relied upon
1155=Dave's Redistricting App for his software, correct?
1156=     A    That is correct.
fmt=pb
1157=     Q    Are there other standards that are used in
1158=the redistricting community, other tools like that?
1159=     A    Yeah.  There's a variety of maps.
1160=Maptitude is probably the most prominent.  There's
1161=software I know they use in Texas called Red Apple.
1162=Maptitude is the most common.  There's also Esri
1163=offers a product that some groups will use.
1164=     Q    In your experience doing maps, can you
1165=compare the use of Dave's Redistricting App to
1166=Maptitude?
1167=     A    I mean, I think Maptitude is the gold
1168=standard redistricting tool.  When I was drawing the
1169=Belize districts on my own, that's what I used.
1170=I've used Dave's Redistricting, as well.  It's
1171=certainly good as an instructional tool.
1172=     Q    In using Dave's have you ever encountered
1173=any software problems regarding contiguity?
1174=     A    Not that I'm aware of.
1175=     Q    And when you did your review of
1176=Dr. Cervas' maps, did you see any noncontiguity
1177=issues show up on your Dave's App?
1178=     A    I don't know that I checked the contiguity
1179=in Dave's.  I would have downloaded the data into R,
1180=which is a statistical processing tool and looked at
1181=it that way, because there's ways to contiguity via
fmt=pb
1182=that.  But I don't recall seeing anything in the
1183=summary screen for it.  You could also eyeball it.
1184=Those little dots were plain looking at the map.
1185=     Q    What if anything did you do in regard to
1186=third parties in constructing your datasets?
1187=     A    So this is commonplace in political
1188=science.  When you are looking at election results,
1189=there's often three or four small party candidates
1190=or independent candidates.  The general rule is that
1191=you just exclude those.  So if you have an election
1192=where the Republican gets 50 percent and the
1193=Democrat gets 48 percent, you would calculate what's
1194=called the two-party vote, which is just to take
1195=that 98 percent of the vote and split that.  So you
1196=would call it a 51/49 election.
1197=               So all of my political data are
1198=presented that way, in keeping with the standards of
1199=the discipline.
1200=     Q    Okay.  I'll refer you back on Exhibit 16,
1201=Section V of your report.  Does this accurately
1202=reflect your opinion regarding the specified Cervas'
1203=maps?
1204=     A    It does.
1205=     Q    And for the record, this is Pages 9
1206=through 19 of your expert report?
fmt=pb
1207=     A    That is correct.
1208=     Q    And would you explain your analysis in
1209=Section V-a. regarding Cervas map 13a, which is set
1210=forth on Pages 9 through 12 of your report?
1211=     A    Yeah.  So, the first map shown here is
1212=what I call the benchmark map.  It's the enacted
1213=plan that shows the makeup of District 73 and 80.
1214=               And I will apologize for the ugly
1215=color scheme.  It's called the viridis color scheme.
1216=And it has the benefit that colorblind people can
1217=read it, and if you print it in black and white, you
1218=can see the distinctions.  So that's the reason I
1219=use that.
1220=               But basically, this is the district
1221=that's been represented by Representative Shaw since
1222=2000.  And you can see that you have District 73
1223=contained entirely within Madison County.  This is a
1224=heavily Republican district.  And Representative
1225=Shaw represents District 80, which is a heavily
1226=Democratic, heavily African-American district
1227=majority.
1228=     Q    And what was your opinion regarding the
1229=Cervas map 13a did you have any criticisms?
1230=     A    Yes.  So if you look at Dr. Cervas' map,
1231=13a, for example, which is demonstrated on Page 12,
fmt=pb
1232=it takes that map and substantially reconfigures it,
1233=such that there is no majority black district in the
1234=area.  In fact, all the districts that are left in
1235=the area are all heavily Republican districts.  So
1236=this map would be exceedingly unlikely to elect the
1237=black candidate of choice.
1238=     Q    And why is that important?
1239=     A    Well, because the Voting Rights Act, if
1240=you can draw a majority black district, which has
1241=been done, demonstrated by the enacted plan, and if
1242=that district demonstrates racially polarized
1243=voting, you are required to draw the district under
1244=the Voting Rights Act.
1245=     Q    Would you call that a federal requirement
1246=then?
1247=     A    Yes, that's a federal requirement.  There
1248=may be a state analogue that I'm not aware of, but
1249=that is a federal requirement.
1250=     Q    And on Page 11, you set forth a chart
1251=about ecological-inference analysis.  Can you tell
1252=us what that chart is showing and what this means?
1253=     A    So, in I opinion, the best way to
1254=determine if there's racially polarized voting is
1255=just to ask people.  And if we can exit polls,
1256=that's great, but unfortunately we don't have exit
fmt=pb
1257=polls for subsections of Tennessee.  So, what
1258=political scientists in lieu when they don't have
1259=this data is to use a variety of techniques.
1260=               For a long time they used something
1261=called ecological regression, which is just a
1262=regression analysis performed on the precincts in
1263=the area.  The problem with that is that regression
1264=analysis generates a line.  And lines go from
1265=negative infinity to infinity.  So, at a certain
1266=point, you will start generating percentages in
1267=excess of 100 percent or less than zero percent,
1268=which don't exist.
1269=               So, in the '90s Gary King, followed
1270=by some other political scientists and
1271=statisticians, came up with something called
1272=ecological inference.  The algorithm is about 12
1273=pages long, so I won't go into the details.  But the
1274=basic idea is that it uses statistical techniques to
1275=place limits on that line so you don't get absurd
1276=estimates.  And to my understanding, this is a
1277=widely accepted method for determining how subgroups
1278=vote in courts across the country.  I don't think
1279=it's controversial.
1280=     Q    And in light of this analysis you have
1281=talked about, would you summarize your opinion
fmt=pb
1282=regarding map 13a, which you show on Page 12 of your
1283=expert report?
1284=     A    So, as you can see from the table on Page
1285=11, the estimate is that the black vote in this
1286=district enacted by the legislature, about
1287=three-quarters of the black population votes
1288=Democrat.  About a little more than three-fifths of
1289=the Republicans vote Republican, so you have
1290=racially polarized voting in the area.  So, Dr.
1291=Cervas' map 13a would dismantle a functioning Voting
1292=Rights Act district causing problems for the
1293=legislature enacting that map.
1294=     Q    Let me refer you to Section V-b. which
1295=starts on Page 12 and 13 of your report.  Did you
1296=perform any analysis of Cervas map 13b?
1297=     A    Yeah.  So, Dr. Cervas mentioned that it
1298=had been brought to his attention in his report that
1299=this might have caused VRA problems.  So there's
1300=some additional maps that attempt to address this
1301=issue.
1302=               The problem with these maps is that
1303=as we can see from Cervas map 13a and from the
1304=enacted map on Page 10, you can draw a district
1305=wholly within Madison County there.  And Dr. Cervas'
1306=map, which is illustrated on Page 13, while it does
fmt=pb
1307=draw a majority "VVAP" district, it does not draw a
1308=district that's wholly contained within Madison
1309=County.
1310=               And we know you can do that while
1311=respecting the Voting Rights Act, because that's
1312=what the enacted plan does.  It draws that Voting
1313=Rights Act complied district, while maintaining a
1314=district that's wholly within Madison County.
1315=     Q    Okay.  And referring you now to Page 13
1316=and 14 of your expert report, did you do analysis of
1317=Cervas map 14a?
1318=     A    Yes.  So, Dr. Cervas' map in 14 doesn't
1319=bind itself by the legislature's districts
1320=elsewhere.  But once again, it creates the same
1321=problem of not drawing a district that could be
1322=contained wholly within Madison County.  So it's run
1323=into the same problem as the preceding map.
1324=     Q    Does 14a create any problems with Shelby
1325=County?
1326=     A    So that, I believe, is later in the report
1327=where it crosses --
1328=     Q    Maps 13.5a and 13.5b, I'm sorry.
1329=     A    So, maps 13.5a and 13.5b have the same
1330=issue with Madison County.  They don't create maps
1331=that are wholly within.  In addition, if you look at
fmt=pb
1332=the illustrations, the blowups on Pages 17 and 18,
1333=this map includes a district that traverses the
1334=Shelby County, Tipton County boundary, which to my
1335=understanding you are not allowed to do without
1336=offering some sort of justification.  And I didn't
1337=see a justification offered in the Cervas report.
1338=     Q    And on Section V-e. of your report, it's
1339=entitled "Dr. Cervas' maps do not Account for
1340=Legitimate Districting Considerations."  Could you
1341=explain what those considerations are, if any?
1342=     A    Yes.  So, I was asked by counsel to look
1343=at other considerations that Courts have employed
1344=besides minimizing county splits.  So there's a
1345=couple factors that States take account of.  The
1346=first is core retention, which at least in some
1347=federal courts has been recognized as a legitimate
1348=redistricting principle.  And the second is avoiding
1349=incumbent parings.
1350=               So, if you look at the tables
1351=included on Page 19, you can see the various maps
1352=that have been proposed:  The enacted map, A13, B13,
1353=A14, and then A and B13.5 and compare the amount of
1354=core retention in those maps versus the enacted
1355=plan.  And you can see in every situation the
1356=enacted plan offers higher core retention than any
fmt=pb
1357=of Dr. Cervas' alternative plans.
1358=     Q    And you didn't get to write a rebuttal
1359=report in this case, did you?
1360=     A    No, I did not.
1361=     Q    And did you do any further review of
1362=Cervas map 13c after Dr. Cervas appended his
1363=rebuttal report December 2nd, 2022?
1364=     A    I did read Dr. Cervas' rebuttal report,
1365=the initial one.
1366=     Q    Okay.  Did you find any problems with map
1367=13c?
1368=     A    So, as I recall that, map had contiguity
1369=issues with it.  There were a couple of
1370=noncontiguous districts that were drawn.
1371=     Q    Going back to your Exhibit 16, the expert
1372=report you filed in this case, did you have an
1373=opinion regarding the enacted map, which is the map
1374=that the legislature approved?
1375=     A    Yeah.  So, if you look, for example, at
1376=the core retention table on Page 19 -- I probably
1377=should have explained.  Core retention is the
1378=percentage of the population in the earlier district
1379=benchmark plan that is maintained together in a
1380=single district in the subsequent plan.  It's a
1381=measure of how much a subsequent plan breaks up the
fmt=pb
1382=districts contained in earlier plans.
1383=               The enacted plan pays some attention
1384=to county splits, but it also, unlike the Cervas
1385=maps that were offered to that point, pays attention
1386=to core retention.  Another thing, on Table 19 is
1387=that the maps that were offered by Dr. Cervas we
1388=call it double bunking incumbents, putting two
1389=incumbents in the same district.  They double bunked
1390=between 16 and 24 districts, where as the enacted
1391=plan double bunks 6.
1392=               So to kind of summarize, in my
1393=experience, and I think everyone who draws maps
1394=would agree with this, drawing maps involves
1395=balancing a large number of complicated
1396=considerations.  It's one of the things that I tell
1397=my students when they come to me and say, We want to
1398=do A, B, and C but we couldn't do A.
1399=               And I say, You are doing a great job
1400=with the assignment because that's the lesson, is
1401=that mapping is hard.  And it involves balancing
1402=various competing situations that trade off.
1403=               And the enacted map balances these
1404=considerations.  It double bunks very few
1405=incumbents.  It retains a high degree of district
1406=cores.  It respects the Voting Rights Act.  And it
fmt=pb
1407=pays attention to county splits.
1408=     Q    Thank you.  And does your report on Pages
1409=19 and 20 accurately reflect your conclusions
1410=regarding this case?
1411=     A    Yes, sir.
1412=     Q    Now just briefly, compared to the
1413=situation in Virginia, when you were working there,
1414=that redistricting wasn't because of a census being
1415=done, but it was because of gerrymandering issues;
1416=is that correct?
1417=     A    Well, the redistricting was occasioned, of
1418=course, by the census, but it was done in a very
1419=unique circumstance.  Virginia had just passed a
1420=constitutional amendment banning political
1421=gerrymandering.  And it set forth very specific
1422=criteria that had to be followed.  And it was
1423=supposed to be drawn by an independent redistricting
1424=commission consisting of members of the
1425=majority-minority parties, but that commission
1426=deadlocked and didn't pass maps.
1427=               So Dr. Grofman and I were appointed
1428=by the Supreme Court of Virginia, and we worked
1429=closely with the Supreme Court of Virginia in
1430=drawing those maps.  And since it was the first pass
1431=on this, we had -- I can't go into details because
fmt=pb
1432=of a gag order or nondisclosure statement.  But, you
1433=know, it was a collaborative process finding out
1434=what Virginia Law meant since it was the first pass
1435=on this constitutional amendment.
1436=     Q    Is it fair to say if there are
1437=gerrymandering issues, that changes the way you look
1438=at trying to keep core retention when you are
1439=redistricting?
1440=     A    Yes.  So in a state like Virginia, which
1441=honestly had just terrible district lines.  It was
1442=like a Rorschach inkblot, because the Democrats had
1443=gerrymandered the senate.  The Republicans had
1444=gerrymandered the state house.  The Democrats
1445=controlled the state senate in 2011, and Republicans
1446=controlled the house of Delegates.  So there was
1447=kind of an agreement:  We'll just draw our own maps.
1448=               And if we had respected core
1449=retention and tried to avoid pairing incumbents
1450=there, we would have validated the political
1451=gerrymander that the voters of Virginia had
1452=rejected.  So in that circumstances, you wouldn't
1453=want to take consideration of either of those
1454=things.
1455=               These traditional redistricting
1456=criteria really are context specific, and in
fmt=pb
1457=different context, Courts might look different at
1458=them.  But core retention in a non-gerrymandered
1459=situation just has a different role than in a really
1460=aggressive gerrymander like we encountered in
1461=Virginia.
1462=     Q    Thank you.
1463=          MR. HART:  No further questions, Your
1464=     Honor.  Pass the witness.
1465=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
1466=          MR. HART:  Before I do, we would like to
1467=     move Exhibit No. 16 to be admitted into the
1468=     record.
1469=          MR. GARRISON:  No objections, Your Honor.
1470=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibit 16 is admitted
1471=     without objection.
1472=                              (The above-referred to
1473=                              document was thereupon

1477=          MR. GARRISON:  Your Honor, David Garrison
1478=     on behalf of the Plaintiffs.  May I proceed?

1481=
1482=CROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. GARRISON:
1483=     Q    Mr. Trende, I just want to be clear, your
fmt=pb
1484=task in this case was to examine Dr. Cervas' report,
1485=correct?
1486=     A    That is correct.
1487=     Q    Okay.  And so you did not examine whether
1488=the legislative house districts passed by the
1489=Tennessee legislature could have resulted in fewer
1490=than 30 county splits, correct?
1491=     A    Well, I did by examining Dr. Cervas' map.
1492=There are more maps that can be drawn than there are
1493=quirks in the universe.  There's no way I could have
1494=looked at every individual map to determine whether
1495=it's possible to draw a legal map with fewer county
1496=splits.  All I can look at reasonably are the maps
1497=that are presented.
1498=     Q    Right.  And so what I'm asking you is you
1499=looked at Dr. Cervas' maps, which of course some of
1500=them do divide fewer than 30 counties, but you
1501=didn't on your own determine whether you could draw
1502=state house maps for Tennessee with fewer than 30
1503=county splits that still met federal constitutional
1504=standards and met other requirements, right?
1505=     A    I didn't go looking for maps that you
1506=described.  And I could never prove that such maps
1507=don't exist, because there's just such a
1508=mind-boggling large number of maps out there.
fmt=pb
1509=     Q    Okay.  I'm going to try this again.  I
1510=didn't ask what you looked for.  I asked what you
1511=did.  I just want to make clear --
1512=     A    Yeah.
1513=     Q    -- you did not look at the Tennessee house
1514=legislative maps and determine whether fewer
1515=counties could be split while still meeting federal
1516=constitutional standards and other standards that
1517=you have described here today, right?
1518=     A    Right.  I didn't engage in that exercise,
1519=because ultimately there's no way I could have
1520=proved that one way or the other.  So that's why I
1521=did not do that.
1522=     Q    Well, you weren't asked to do that, right?
1523=     A    I wasn't asked to do that.
1524=     Q    Did you do everything you were asked to
1525=do?
1526=     A    Oh, I don't know about that.  Sometimes
1527=I'm asked to do things, and I say, I don't know if I
1528=can do.
1529=     Q    What's an example that you were asked to
1530=do that you don't know that you weren't able to do?
1531=     A    My point is just I can't remember anything
1532=here.
1533=     Q    You don't recall anything?
fmt=pb
1534=     A    I don't recall.
1535=     Q    Okay.  So your task here was to examine
1536=Dr. Cervas' maps, correct?
1537=     A    That's correct.
1538=     Q    All right.  I want to go back to your
1539=report.  Do you still have it in front of you?
1540=     A    Yes, sir.
1541=     Q    All right.  And counsel has asked you to
1542=describe your summary of opinions set forth here on
1543=Page 7.  Do you see that?
1544=     A    Yes, sir.
1545=     Q    And do you recall walking through those?
1546=     A    I do.
1547=     Q    Now, you also, after drafting this report,
1548=you reviewed Dr. Cervas' map 13d, correct?
1549=     A    Yeah.  The letters kind of blur together
1550=at this point, but I do believe that I looked at
1551=maps that were drafted subsequent to my report.
1552=     Q    Okay.  And I want to get to that map in
1553=just a second.  Would you agree with me that
1554=subsequent maps that were produced by Dr. Cervas
1555=address some of the concerns you lay out here in
1556=these bullet points?
1557=     A    They purport to, yeah.
1558=     Q    Okay.  So, for example, do you agree that
fmt=pb
1559=maps that were produced by Dr. Cervas subsequent to
1560=your opinion, for example on this first bullet
1561=point, Dr. Cervas produced a map that's labeled 13d
1562=that preserves the same Voting Rights Act district
1563=in Madison County, correct?
1564=     A    I would have to review the map but I
1565=will -- I have no reason to believe that you are
1566=misrepresenting it so.
1567=     Q    Okay.  Well, would you like to review the
1568=map?
1569=     A    I would.
1570=     Q    Okay.  I would like for you to turn to
1571=Exhibit 9 that I believe should be in front of you.
1572=     A    Yes, sir.
1573=     Q    And if you could turn to Page 5.
1574=     A    (Witness complies.)
1575=     Q    And so this is the map 13d that I was
1576=referring to.  And you had this map that was
1577=produced by Dr. Cervas after you produced this
1578=report, right?
1579=     A    That's correct.
1580=     Q    Okay.  And so, you would agree that this
1581=map doesn't, quote, play chicken, end quote, with
1582=the Voting Rights Act the way that the maps that you
1583=were reviewing when you produced your report
fmt=pb
1584=allegedly did, right?
1585=     A    That is correct.
1586=     Q    Okay.  And then, you would also agree that
1587=Dr. Cervas' map 13 did not create the same
1588=difficulties that you described in your second
1589=bullet point in your report involving Madison
1590=County, right?
1591=     A    Yeah, I think that's right.  I think
1592=there's a line.  I think that's two blue districts
1593=above District 80 so, yeah.
1594=     Q    Right.  And you would agree that Dr.
1595=Cervas' map 13d are the same as the State's enacted
1596=map which respected core preservation and incumbent
1597=protection, correct?
1598=     A    I haven't done the calculations myself,
1599=but I have no reason to believe Dr. Cervas is
1600=misleading me.
1601=     Q    Okay.  And I think you were aware that
1602=Dr. Cervas didn't have the benefit of having the
1603=incumbents' addresses when producing his initial
1604=maps that you examined in your report, right, you're
1605=aware of that?
1606=     A    Um, I am now.
1607=     Q    Okay.  And it's impossible to take into
1608=account incumbent protection without having the
fmt=pb
1609=benefit of knowing where the incumbents reside,
1610=right?
1611=     A    That's correct.
1612=     Q    And you would agree that 13d has similar
1613=core preservations as the enacted map, right?
1614=     A    Again, assuming the calculations are
1615=correct, yeah.
1616=     Q    Well, do you remember when Mr. Tift took
1617=your deposition?
1618=     A    Yes.
1619=     Q    And do you recall when he asked you, do
1620=you agree that 13d has similar core preservation to
1621=the enacted map?
1622=     A    I have no reason to dispute you.
1623=     Q    Okay.  And do you recall that your
1624=response to that question was "Yes"?
1625=     A    I again have no reason to dispute you, but
1626=assuming that the calculations are correct, they are
1627=the same.
1628=     Q    Okay.  Could you look at Tab 6 in front of
1629=you?
1630=     A    (Witness complies.)
1631=     Q    And do you see that's a copy of your
1632=deposition?
1633=     A    Yes, sir.
fmt=pb
1634=     Q    And could you turn to Page 42, and I'm
1635=going to read from line 18:
1636=               "Q.  And do you agree that 13d has
1637=similar core preservation to the enacted map?"
1638=               "A. Yes."
1639=               Did I read that right?
1640=     A    Yes.
1641=     Q    And then, I'm going to read further on
1642=line 21:
1643=               "Q.  You agree that 13d has similar
1644=incumbency protection to the enacted map?"
1645=               "A.  Yes."
1646=               Did I read that right?
1647=     A    Yes.
1648=     Q    And 13d refers to the map labeled 13d that
1649=was drawn by Dr. Cervas, right?
1650=     A    That's correct.
1651=     Q    And enacted map refers to the state of
1652=Tennessee enacted house map, correct?
1653=     A    That is right.
1654=     Q    Okay.  Now, you referred to Dr. Grofman
1655=earlier, right?
1656=     A    Yes.
1657=     Q    You and Dr. Grofman used Dave's
1658=Redistricting App as co-special masters in Virginia,
fmt=pb
1659=right?
1660=     A    Yes.  Dr. Grofman had access to it.  And
1661=for two people drawing maps across the country from
1662=each other, that made the most sense.
1663=     Q    Going back to District 80 in Dr. Cervas'
1664=maps, you only performed a voting rights analysis
1665=for District 80 in Dr. Cervas' maps, not statewide,
1666=right?
1667=     A    That is correct.
1668=     Q    And in your report you agree that maps 13b
1669=and 14a include a District 80 maintained as a
1670=50 percent plus black district where the Democrat
1671=would likely win?
1672=     A    That is correct.
1673=     Q    Now, I also --
1674=     A    By candidate of choice.
1675=     Q    Yes.  I want to move back to your
1676=testimony on 13c, which is a map produced by
1677=Dr. Cervas, right?
1678=     A    Yes.
1679=     Q    And I think you provided some testimony
1680=earlier about whether that map had noncontiguities
1681=or not.  Do you recall that?
1682=     A    Yes.
1683=     Q    And I think you testified earlier when
fmt=pb
1684=State's counsel was asking you questions that it
1685=might have had some; is that right?
1686=     A    Yes.
1687=     Q    I want to circle back to on Tab 6, your
1688=deposition.  You were asked about this in the
1689=deposition taken by Mr. Tift.  I want you to turn to
1690=Page 40.
1691=     A    Okay.
1692=     Q    Line 11:
1693=               Q.  "Did counsel, well, let's say you
1694=stated that one of the two maps in this report had a
1695=noncontiguity, which map is that?"
1696=               "A.  I believe that's 13c."
1697=               "Q.  Okay.  Where is the
1698=noncontiguity?"
1699=               "A.  I don't remember.  I looked at
1700=it briefly."
1701=               Did I read that right?
1702=     A    Yes.
1703=     Q    And is your testimony today the same as it
1704=was then on this issue?
1705=     A    Yes.
1706=     Q    Okay.  Now, Mr. Trende, you have no
1707=opinion concerning whether the General Assembly
1708=could have created a house map with fewer county
fmt=pb
1709=splitting districts than the enacted map while still
1710=complying with federal constitutional requirements?
1711=     A    That is correct.
1712=     Q    You also have no opinion concerning
1713=whether the General Assembly actually tried to
1714=create a house map with fewer county splitting
1715=districts than the enacted house map while still
1716=complying with federal constitutional requirements,
1717=right?
1718=     A    That is correct.
1719=     Q    And you have no opinion on whether the
1720=enacted house map demonstrates on its face that the
1721=General Assembly sought to divide as few counties as
1722=necessary to comply with federal constitutional
1723=standards?
1724=     A    That is correct.
1725=     Q    Now, we have been talking a lot about the
1726=enacted map.  You have no opinions about the state
1727=senate map, correct?
1728=     A    I was not asked to look at it and I have
1729=not.  I have no opinions.
1730=     Q    I'm glad you answered that way.  That made
1731=for a quick examination on the senate map.
1732=               Now, you understand Dr. Cervas is an
1733=expert retained by the Plaintiffs in this case,
fmt=pb
1734=correct?
1735=          MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, objection to the
1736=     extent that they call Dr. Cervas an expert.  We
1737=     dispute that.
1738=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.  Thank you.
1739=          MR. GARRISON:  Well, that's how Plaintiffs
1740=     have retained Dr. Cervas, and you have admitted
1741=     him as an expert.
1742=          CHIEF JUDGE:  That's an objection to the
1743=     form and I'll overrule the objection.
1744=          THE WITNESS:  I admit you have retained
1745=     him to be an expert on your behalf.
1746=     Q    (By Mr. Garrison) Right.  You understand
1747=that's his role in this case, correct?
1748=     A    Right.  I understand that's why you have
1749=retained him, as an expert in that role.  I don't
1750=know how the Court has ruled on that.
1751=     Q    What's your understanding about what Dr.
1752=Cervas' role is in this litigation?
1753=     A    I understand he was retained by Plaintiffs
1754=to provide an opinion on the constitutionality of
1755=the Tennessee house maps.
1756=     Q    Okay.  And what's your role in this
1757=litigation?
1758=     A    I was retained by Defendants to examine
fmt=pb
1759=Dr. Cervas' report and the maps that he drew.
1760=     Q    Okay.  And do you understand that
1761=Dr. Cervas has put together a number of maps?
1762=     A    Yes.
1763=     Q    Not just one, right?
1764=     A    That's right.
1765=     Q    And do you understand that Dr. Cervas, his
1766=role here is not to draw a map for the state of
1767=Tennessee to enact or for this Court to enact?
1768=     A    Yes.  Like I said, they are demonstration
1769=maps similar to the VRA step one Gingles.
1770=     Q    And would you agree that what Dr. Cervas'
1771=maps attempt to do is show that Tennessee house
1772=districts could be drawn such that fewer counties
1773=than 30 are split while still meeting federal
1774=constitutional requirements?
1775=     A    I do understand that is what he is
1776=offering opinions to try to do, yes.
1777=     Q    And would you agree map 13d does that?
1778=     A    I couldn't give that opinion.
1779=     Q    But you agree that 13d maintains the same
1780=core preservation and the same incumbent protection
1781=that the State's enacted map does?
1782=     A    Yes.
1783=          MR. GARRISON:  Nothing further.
fmt=pb
1784=          MR. HART:  There's nothing else for this
1785=     witness, Your Honor.  And may he be excused?
1786=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Any objection to the witness
1787=     being excused?
1788=          MR. GARRISON:  No.
1789=          CHIEF JUDGE:  You are excused, sir.
1790=          THE WITNESS:  Thank you, Your Honor.
1791=     Thank you for accommodating my schedule.
1792=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Yes, sir.  Happy to do so.
1793=          Next witness.
1794=          MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, Plaintiffs' counsel
1795=     would ask Dr. Cervas to return to the witness
1796=     chair.
1797=          MR. HART:  Your Honor, may I just have a
1798=     moment to thank him before he leaves.
1799=          CHIEF JUDGE:  You May.
1800=          MR. HART:  Thank you, Your Honor.
1801=                       - - -
1802=
1803=DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. TIFT:
1804=     Q    All right.  Dr. Cervas, we'll continue in
1805=your Direct Examination and just confirm, as you
1806=have already heard today, you are still under oath.
1807=               Dr. Cervas, at any point in time have
1808=you identified or has anybody identified for you any
fmt=pb
1809=noncontiguities in your map 13c?
1810=     A    No.  Nobody has identified noncontiguities
1811=in 13c.  And I have checked multiple times over and
1812=over, and I have not identified any myself.
1813=     Q    Okay.  When we left off, we were on map
1814=13d and the report of yours from January of this
1815=year that is in Tab, I believe, 10.  Let me grab it
1816=to confirm.  And again, Tab 10 was your January 9th,
1817=2023 response to the Defendants' deposition expert
1818=testimony.  Do you have that back in front of you?
1819=     A    I do.
1820=     Q    And you just talked about the concern
1821=about a double split in Sullivan County.  Did we
1822=leave anything out?  Anything else you need to say
1823=about that about dealing with the double split going
1824=from 13d to 13e?  Have we covered that topic fully?
1825=     A    I have nothing else to add about that.
1826=But just a reminder that I believe that 13d is a
1827=fine way of drawing a map.
1828=     Q    Okay.  And so we have talked about the
1829=concern of the double split.  Now I believe you
1830=stated that was other criticism that you were made
1831=aware of through Defendants' experts depositions was
1832=a few more noncontiguous census blocks issues; is
1833=that correct?
fmt=pb
1834=     A    Yes.  On the map on Figure 4 on Page 3,
1835=you will see that I have shown the blown up region
1836=of 13d_e.  What you can't see from here are
1837=noncontiguities because they are not plain to the
1838=eye.  But they do exist in 13d_e in District 1 and
1839=between District 1 and 3, two noncontiguous census
1840=blocks with zero population.
1841=     Q    Okay.  So, 13d_e we are now speaking
1842=about.  Sorry, I think I said 13d.  Concerning 13d_e
1843=were you made aware of any noncontiguities in 13d_e?
1844=     A    I was after the fact.  The two I just
1845=mentioned, the two, zero population noncontiguities.
1846=     Q    And were you made aware of in 13d_e any
1847=populated noncontiguities?
1848=     A    There was the one that was between
1849=Districts 69 and District 78, Dickson County.
1850=     Q    Okay.  We don't need to get up and go
1851=through in detail, but does your demonstrative
1852=that's before us showing Sullivan County Districts 1
1853=and 3 represent the two non-population,
1854=noncontiguities that you were made aware of for
1855=13d_e?
1856=     A    Yes.
1857=     Q    And we walked through yesterday, but are
1858=you able to assign these to their correct district
fmt=pb
1859=without having any effect on the map's total
1860=variance?
1861=     A    Yes.  It would be very easy to make these
1862=corrections in a matter of seconds, and it would
1863=have no effect on my analysis or my overall
1864=conclusion.
1865=     Q    You may have said before.  When you
1866=removed the double split from Sullivan County, did
1867=that change the number of county splits in the
1868=overall map from map d to map d_e?
1869=     A    It did not change it at all.
1870=     Q    And would correcting these two
1871=noncontiguous, zero population census blocks have
1872=any effect on the number of splits in your maps 13d,
1873=d_e and d_e after correction?
1874=     A    No, it would have no effect.
1875=     Q    And then, concerning the third,
1876=noncontiguous census block in 13d_e does your second
1877=demonstrative now before everyone here showing
1878=Districts 78 and 69, are you able to assign this
1879=noncontiguous district to the district that it
1880=actually abuts?
1881=     A    Yes.  It would be a matter of seconds to
1882=make the change.
1883=     Q    And I understand that census block has 11
fmt=pb
1884=people in it?
1885=     A    Yes.
1886=     Q    Okay.  And does assigning those 11 people
1887=to the district that they are actually abutting
1888=affect the total variation at all in your maps 13d,
1889=d_e?
1890=     A    It would not.
1891=     Q    And would assigning that census block to
1892=the district that it actually abuts affect the total
1893=variance of the map at all?
1894=     A    It would not.
1895=     Q    And why would that not affect the total
1896=variance?
1897=     A    The total or overall variance is the
1898=largest and the smallest district.  And when
1899=reassigning that 11 persons to District 69, neither
1900=of those districts would be among the top or the
1901=bottom.  So it would have no effect on the total
1902=overall deviation.
1903=     Q    Okay.  So, after the contiguity
1904=corrections, what would be the total variance of the
1905=map?
1906=     A    It would remain the same, 9.89 percent.
1907=     Q    And how many majority-minority districts
1908=are in 13d_e.
fmt=pb
1909=     A    It would still be the same 13 as exist in
1910=enacted map.
1911=     Q    And would that change in any way after
1912=reassigning the three, noncontiguous census blocks?
1913=     A    Not at all.
1914=     Q    Okay.  And how many county splits are in
1915=13d_e?
1916=     A    There are 24.
1917=     Q    And would that number change at all based
1918=on reassigning the three, noncontiguous census
1919=blocks?
1920=     A    No.
1921=     Q    After reassigning the three, noncontiguous
1922=census blocks would the map be contiguous?
1923=     A    Yes.
1924=     Q    Or contain contiguous districts?
1925=     A    All districts would be contiguous.
1926=     Q    Would the process of reassigning the
1927=three, noncontiguous census blocks affect the core
1928=retention at all as compared to 13d_e?
1929=     A    It doesn't have a meaningful effect.  It
1930=may have a very small in the very far out decimals.
1931=But population wise, the zero population would have
1932=no effect.  The 11 one would have a very tiny
1933=effect.  But even rounded out, it's not going to
fmt=pb
1934=have an effect that's going to be measurable.
1935=     Q    In map 13d, which had as you have
1936=testified one or more noncontiguous census blocks,
1937=when you created that map, did the Dave's
1938=Redistricting software show to you any
1939=noncontiguities?
1940=     A    No.
1941=     Q    I guess what I mean is did the
1942=noncontiguity tool in DRA reflect noncontiguities
1943=when you created map 13d?
1944=     A    No.
1945=     Q    And when you created 13d_e did Dave's
1946=Redistricting App noncontiguity tool reflect any
1947=noncontiguities?
1948=     A    No.
1949=     Q    Is there anything else from your
1950=January 9th report that we haven't discussed that is
1951=part of your opinion in this case?
1952=     A    My opinion remains that the state could
1953=have enacted a plan with far fewer county splits
1954=than they did.
1955=     Q    Let's go back to your October report,
1956=which is Exhibit 8.  So we have been talking about
1957=what I would call your 13 series of maps.  Now I
1958=would like to ask about 14a.  If you could, remind
fmt=pb
1959=us what's the difference between the 13 being at the
1960=start of the name or 14 being at the start of the
1961=name.
1962=     A    The difference between this and the 13
1963=plans are going to now be 14 total districts in
1964=Shelby County with no district in Shelby County
1965=being placed with any other county.
1966=     Q    Does having 14 districts in Shelby County
1967=cause Shelby County itself to have one person, one
1968=vote problems?
1969=     A    It does.  Shelby County's population does
1970=not fit neatly between having 13 or 14 districts.
1971=In either case, either all the districts will have
1972=too many people or too few people.
1973=     Q    In having too many or too few, will they
1974=cross the 10 percent number that you have been
1975=speaking about?
1976=     A    No.  So, as long as you balance all the
1977=populations between the districts, they can be
1978=within the range acceptable by the Court.
1979=     Q    And so, under one person, one vote can
1980=Shelby County support 13 whole districts or 14 whole
1981=districts?
1982=     A    According to the allowable deviations
1983=established after the 1960 series of
fmt=pb
1984=malapportionment court cases, Shelby County can have
1985=between 13 or 14 districts.
1986=     Q    And what were you trying to illustrate
1987=with map 14a?
1988=     A    The major illustration here is that
1989=legislature could have opted to draw 14 districts in
1990=Shelby County, and in doing so, could have reduced
1991=the number of overall splits in the plan compared to
1992=what the enacted plan was.
1993=     Q    And your map 14a, what is its total
1994=population variation?
1995=     A    14a has a total overall population
1996=deviation of 9.98.
1997=     Q    And how many county splits are in your map
1998=14a?
1999=     A    It has a total of 24 county splits.
2000=     Q    And how many majority-minority districts
2001=are in 14a?
2002=     A    There are 15 districts with a black voting
2003=age population majority.
2004=     Q    At some point were you made aware of any
2005=zero population, noncontiguous census blocks in map
2006=14a?
2007=     A    I was, yes.
2008=     Q    And did you subsequently correct those
fmt=pb
2009=noncontiguous census blocks?
2010=     A    I did.
2011=     Q    And did you publish the link to the
2012=correction in the rebuttal we looked at previously?
2013=     A    In Exhibit 9, I provided a link and a
2014=footnote to that map.
2015=     Q    Okay.  Now I would like to look at your
2016=13.5 series, and can you again explain to us what's
2017=the meaning of it being called 13.5?
2018=     A    As I indicated, Shelby County can have
2019=based on its population between 13 and 14 districts.
2020=Of course, if you are not going to break the county
2021=line, it has to be either 13 or 14.  But one could
2022=also draw the plan where there are 13 complete
2023=districts and one that will connect to an adjacent
2024=county.  And these two maps, 13.5a and 13.5b do
2025=exactly that.
2026=     Q    And from a mapmaking perspective, why
2027=would you want to explore breaking this Shelby line
2028=as you stated?
2029=     A    The major consequence of not breaking the
2030=county line is that all of the districts are going
2031=to be either overpopulated or underpopulated.  And
2032=if you allow for population from another county to
2033=be used in one of the districts, you can reduce the
fmt=pb
2034=variance of each individual district as close as
2035=possible to the ideal, which is the spirit of the
2036=Equal Protection Clause as interpreted by the US
2037=Supreme Court.
2038=     Q    And on map 13.5a now walk us through what
2039=you did to get to that.
2040=     A    So essentially, we have a new map.  As I
2041=have stated, all the maps that are under the 13
2042=series, the Shelby County districts don't change at
2043=all.  Under these, because you are by necessity
2044=having to change Shelby County, because the
2045=districts are going to have fewer people closer to
2046=the ideal and an adjacent county is going to be
2047=included in those districts, all of the surrounding
2048=counties are also going to need to change.
2049=               As we have indicated earlier in
2050=testimony, redistricting is like a big puzzle.  So
2051=once you make one change, there needs to be changes
2052=in other areas, as well.  So I did continue to make
2053=those changes.  And in 13.5a the overall deviation
2054=ends up going up slightly, but the number of county
2055=splits is the lowest I was able to find in any plan.
2056=     Q    And to break those two down, what is the
2057=total variance in your map 13.5a?
2058=     A    The total variance is 9.98.
fmt=pb
2059=     Q    And what are the total number of county
2060=splits in 13.5a?
2061=     A    County splits, 22.
2062=     Q    And then, you have also included map
2063=13.5b.  What led you to 13.5b?
2064=     A    So the difference between 13.5a and 13.5b
2065=is how I treated Montgomery County.  Montgomery
2066=County is the county that the legislature did not
2067=allow the districts to go beyond its border.  It
2068=contains three districts.  And all districts have
2069=the deviation that are above 5 percent.  They are at
2070=5.09.
2071=               In this plan one of the things I did
2072=was I took extra population from the surrounding
2073=districts of Montgomery County to alleviate that
2074=pressure that existed, the pressure of the
2075=populations there.  So those districts are no longer
2076=the top districts in the state.
2077=     Q    And then, what about looking back to Page
2078=16 on 13.5a, did your work moving to 13.5b have
2079=anything to do with the number of black voting age
2080=population districts in 13.5a?
2081=     A    Yeah.  Again, I wasn't drawing with any
2082=kind of racial motivations.  And that's how
2083=districtors are supposed to act.  The US Supreme
fmt=pb
2084=Court says that we should not have racial targets.
2085=Racial targets are unconstitutional.  So in this
2086=particular case, the drawing that I did in 13.5a
2087=resulted in 11 districts that have black populations
2088=that exceed 50 percent and another two that are
2089=between 47.56 and 49.19 percent.  That's black
2090=voting age population.
2091=               Mr. Trende used the term block
2092=opportunity districts.  That's actually the term
2093=that is used in voting rights litigation.  Districts
2094=need not actually be drawn above 50 percent.  In
2095=fact doing so, stating that I drew this district to
2096=be above 50 percent is really a potential problem
2097=with the US Supreme Court.  So the question is
2098=whether these districts would give the opportunity
2099=to elect the candidate of choice for voters in this
2100=area.
2101=               And I say in my report that one would
2102=want to ensure this with a clear factual analysis,
2103=but I believe that these districts would still allow
2104=for the voters to elect the candidates of their
2105=choice in these districts.
2106=     Q    Did some of your changes for 13.5b speak
2107=to that question?
2108=     A    Yes.  So as I say on Page 17, 13 districts
fmt=pb
2109=have black voting age populations above 50 percent
2110=consistent with the enacted plan.
2111=     Q    So is what you are saying is the enacted
2112=plan has 13 districts where the black voting age
2113=population is above 50 percent?
2114=     A    The enacted plan has 13 that are above 50
2115=percent.  This plan has 13 that are above
2116=50 percent.
2117=     Q    And what's the total population variation
2118=in 13.5b?
2119=     A    The total deviation of this plan is 9.82
2120=percent.
2121=     Q    And how many county splits are in plan
2122=13.5b?
2123=     A    This plan includes 24 county splits.
2124=     Q    Now, for this report, did you also review
2125=a map that had been proposed by Representative
2126=Freeman during public hearings?  I believe you refer
2127=to it as a senate Democratic Concept map?
2128=     A    It would be the house Concept map?
2129=     Q    Yes.
2130=     A    I was asked by Plaintiffs' counsel to
2131=review that plan.
2132=     Q    And to correct my language there, on Page
2133=12, you refer to it as the house Democratic Concept
fmt=pb
2134=map, correct?
2135=     A    That is correct.
2136=     Q    And does the house Democratic Concept map
2137=cross Shelby's border?
2138=     A    Yes.
2139=     Q    And so it would be a 13.5 map?
2140=     A    Yes.
2141=     Q    And what's the total population variance
2142=of the house Democratic Concept map?
2143=     A    The overall deviation in this map is 9.72
2144=percent.
2145=     Q    And how many counties are split in the
2146=house Democratic Concept map?
2147=     A    I believe and I'm going to search for it
2148=in the text just to make sure, but there are 23
2149=county splits in this map.
2150=     Q    Okay.  And then, about 13.5a and 13.5b at
2151=any point were you made aware of zero population,
2152=noncontiguous census blocks in those two maps?
2153=     A    Yes.  I was and I made those corrections
2154=in the supplemental report that I filed after the
2155=fact in the footnotes that I identified earlier.
2156=     Q    And that's in your rebuttal report from
2157=December of 2022?
2158=     A    That's right.
fmt=pb
2159=     Q    All right.  And looking at 13.5a and
2160=13.5b, is it your opinion that they both support
2161=your overall opinion as an expert in this case?
2162=     A    Those plans do further support my opinion
2163=that the state could have enacted a plan with far
2164=fewer county splits.
2165=     Q    All right.  So, looking back to your map
2166=13d_e, which again is in Exhibit 10, is the
2167=population variance better than, the same than, or
2168=higher than the enacted house map?
2169=     A    The overall deviation in 13d and its
2170=successor, 13d_e are lower than the enacted plan at
2171=9.89 percent.
2172=     Q    And is that still the case after
2173=correcting the three, noncontiguous census blocks?
2174=     A    That's still the case, yes.
2175=     Q    And how do your map 13d_e and the enacted
2176=map compare on majority-minority districts?
2177=     A    These maps are going to have the same 13
2178=as the enacted map.
2179=     Q    And does that change in any way after
2180=correcting the three noncontiguous census blocks?
2181=     A    The census blocks will not have any effect
2182=on majority-minority districts.
2183=     Q    And how does map 13d_e compare to the
fmt=pb
2184=enacted map on county splits?
2185=     A    The 13d_e has 24 county splits compared to
2186=the enacted map's 30.
2187=     Q    And does that fact change at all after
2188=reassigning the three noncontiguous census blocks?
2189=     A    It has no effect.
2190=     Q    And how does map 13d_e compare to the
2191=enacted map in terms of percentage of core
2192=retention?
2193=     A    Map 13d_e has the exact same core
2194=retention as the enacted plan.
2195=     Q    And how does 13d_e compare to the enacted
2196=house map once corrected on noncontiguities?
2197=     A    Neither plan will have any contiguity
2198=problems.
2199=     Q    And how does map 13d_e compare to the
2200=enacted house map on the amount of incumbency
2201=protection?
2202=     A    Both 13d_e and the enacted plan have six
2203=districts that have incumbents paired against each
2204=other.
2205=     Q    On any metric other than contiguity, does
2206=correcting the three identified noncontiguities
2207=effect the statistics of map 13d_e?
2208=     A    As listed on Table 1?
fmt=pb
2209=     Q    Correct.
2210=     A    It almost certainly will have the effect
2211=of increasing marginally the compactness scores.
2212=And going up is better, so it will make those scores
2213=better.  And the two zero populations could have no
2214=effect on average deviation.  The 11 may have a very
2215=small effect one way or the other, but no meaningful
2216=difference at all.
2217=     Q    Does any noncontiguous census block
2218=identified by Defendants throughout this litigation
2219=in any way affect or undermine your expert opinion
2220=in this case?
2221=     A    Not at all.  In fact, any noncontiguous
2222=census block can be corrected and the plan remains
2223=exactly the same, which is why instead of giving new
2224=names to these plans, I simply put an _e indicating
2225=that they are corrected for these technical errors.
2226=     Q    All right.  Dr. Cervas, can you let the
2227=Court know what is your expert opinion on the
2228=question of whether the General Assembly could have
2229=created a house map based on 2020 census data that
2230=crossed fewer county lines in the enacted house map
2231=and still complied with federal law?
2232=     A    I have given a number of different
2233=illustrative plans all looking at different
fmt=pb
2234=criteria.  And any justification given by the state
2235=for having created their plan none of them justify
2236=having more than at most 25 county splits and as few
2237=as 22 county splits and certainly not 30 county
2238=splits.  So my overall opinion is that the state
2239=absolutely could have drawn a plan with far fewer
2240=than 30 county splits.
2241=          MR. TIFT:  Consult with counsel for a
2242=     brief second.
2243=                    [Thereupon, a discussion off
2244=                    record was had.]
2245=
2246=          MR. TIFT:  That concludes our Direct
2247=     questioning of Dr. Cervas and certainly invite
2248=     the Panel to ask any questions of Dr. Cervas
2249=     now that we are at the close of the proof.
2250=          CHIEF JUDGE:  We're going to take a
2251=     ten-minute break.  But before that, can the
2252=     lawyers give a roadmap for the rest of the day?
2253=          MR. TIFT:  Yes, Your Honor.  Following
2254=     Cross and Redirect, Plaintiffs rest their case,
2255=     and I'll pass it to Defense.
2256=          MR. SWATLEY:  We'll have Doug Himes and
2257=     that probably gets us through the end of the
2258=     day.  We'll see if he carries on into tomorrow.
2259=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Is that your only witness?
fmt=pb
2260=          MR. RIEGER:  Apart from Mr. Trende, yes.
2261=          CHIEF JUDGE:  I meant additional witness.
2262=          MR. SWATLEY:  Yes.
2263=          CHIEF JUDGE:  And then, at some point
2264=     we'll need to take up the deposition Motion in
2265=     Limine issues that we reserve ruling on unless
2266=     you think it's worked out.
2267=          MR. RIEGER:  Certainly, Your Honor, I'm
2268=     sure.
2269=          MR. TIFT:  It will get sorted out.
2270=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.

2278=
2279=CROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. SWATLEY:
2280=     Q    Just a reminder, you are still under oath,
2281=same rules apply as before.
2282=               So this is your first time being an
2283=expert witness?
2284=     A    That's right.
2285=     Q    And first time ever testifying in court?
fmt=pb
2286=     A    Yesterday was the first time I have ever
2287=testified in court, yes.
2288=     Q    And you're not a lawyer, right?
2289=     A    I'm not a lawyer.
2290=     Q    Never been to law school, never crossed
2291=the bar exam, not sworn in to practice by the
2292=Tennessee Supreme Court or any other Supreme Court?
2293=     A    I have walked through law schools.  They
2294=are often very beautiful.  I have audited a class on
2295=election law, but I am not a lawyer.  I do not have
2296=a J.D., and I have no plans to get one at the
2297=moment.
2298=     Q    So, I believe it was in your rebuttal
2299=report on Page 3, you stated you do not respond to
2300=Mr. Himes' or Mr. Trende's legal conclusions because
2301=their legal arguments are the purview of counsel for
2302=the Court to resolve.  That was your statement?
2303=     A    You haven't turned me to that but I do
2304=remember writing that, yes.
2305=     Q    And you agree that Mr. Himes and
2306=Mr. Trende are both lawyers?
2307=     A    My understanding.  I have not seen their
2308=law degrees, but I understand they are both lawyers,
2309=yes.
2310=     Q    And you also testified in your deposition
fmt=pb
2311=on Page 106 that you are not a lawyer, so you
2312=usually don't get into issues of law?
2313=     A    Where did I say that?  I'm sorry.
2314=     Q    We can refer to it.  It's Tab 3, Page 106.
2315=So if you look at line 23 -- and you recall this
2316=deposition that you took in December?
2317=     A    I do.
2318=     Q    And you were under oath for that
2319=deposition?
2320=     A    That's right.
2321=     Q    Just as if you were testifying here in the
2322=courtroom?
2323=     A    Yes.
2324=     Q    And you agree that on Page 23 you said,
2325="I'm not a lawyer so I usually don't get into issues
2326=of law."
2327=     A    Right.  I do not make judgments about what
2328=is legal and not legal.  Those are for the Court to
2329=decide legal issues.
2330=     Q    So this time I'll refer you to your house
2331=report that you did in October.  I believe it's Tab
2332=8 on Page 2.  And it's the section right below the
2333=bolded three lines.  Could you read your sentence
2334=right there for me?
2335=     A    "My illustrative plans adhere to all state
fmt=pb
2336=and federal laws."
2337=     Q    That's a legal conclusion, isn't it?
2338=     A    It might be.  I understand the Law.  I can
2339=read the Law.  The Courts always are the last say of
2340=what is legal and not legal.  I'm not a Court.  I'm
2341=not a judge.  The Court determines those things.
2342=     Q    You say, "My illustrative plans adhere to
2343=all state and federal laws."  But your testimony
2344=earlier was that your map 13a did not?
2345=     A    Right.
2346=     Q    So is that statement untruthful?
2347=     A    It's not complete.  That's right.
2348=     Q    When you say all your plans adhere to
2349=state and federal laws that's not accurate?
2350=     A    Plan 13a is not one that I would suggest
2351=as adhering to federal law as I understand it.
2352=     Q    Is there anything else in any of your
2353=reports that you want to identify now as inaccurate?
2354=     A    There's nothing that I can say off the top
2355=of my head that I find inaccurate.
2356=     Q    Okay.  And your opinions here are based
2357=primarily on the alternative maps you drew in your
2358=reports?
2359=     A    My conclusion that the state could have
2360=drawn a plan with fewer county splits than they did
fmt=pb
2361=to comply with all federal law?
2362=     Q    Is that based on the alternative maps you
2363=drew?
2364=     A    The maps I drew is evidence that the state
2365=could have done it.  I have other reasons to believe
2366=that they could have drawn fewer splits.
2367=     Q    Did you arrive at that conclusion before
2368=or after you drew the map?
2369=     A    Like I just stated, my illustrative maps
2370=are evidence to that point.  I didn't know prior.  I
2371=think I say somewhere in my reports that you can't
2372=analytically determine what is the minimum.  So you
2373=have to actually try to do it.
2374=     Q    So you just stated you can't analytically
2375=determine the minimum number of county splits?
2376=     A    I said that in my report.  I know no way
2377=analytically to do it.  And I know nobody who knows
2378=analytically how to calculate that.
2379=               Mr. Himes testified that there are
2380=more plans possible than atoms in the universe.
2381=There are trillions.  We can't know them all.  So
2382=it's very hard to know what the absolute minimum is.
2383=What we know is you can have plans that have 30 or
2384=you can have plans that have 22, and you can have
2385=plans that are somewhere in between those.
fmt=pb
2386=     Q    Is it fair to say that your maps are only
2387=as good as the criteria according to which they were
2388=drawn?
2389=     A    I don't understand that question.
2390=     Q    Okay.  As we know, there are certain state
2391=and federal laws related to drawing redistricting
2392=maps.  If you don't know those state and federal
2393=law, you can't draw a map that complies with them,
2394=right?
2395=     A    No.  I disagree with that completely
2396=actually.
2397=     Q    Okay.  So, you can draw a map that
2398=complies with state and federal law without knowing
2399=what the state and federal laws are?
2400=     A    Absolutely.  Somebody could draw a map
2401=that complied with all federal laws without
2402=understanding what the Laws are.  Absolutely,
2403=100 percent.
2404=     Q    Do your alternative maps comply with the
2405=plain language of the Tennessee Constitution?
2406=     A    Can you repeat the question?
2407=     Q    You drew 20 plus maps in this case, around
2408=there?
2409=     A    That's not correct, no.
2410=     Q    How many maps did you draw in this case?
fmt=pb
2411=     A    In both the senate and the house?
2412=     Q    Total.
2413=     A    As I have stated already, I consider each
2414=iteration not to be a separate map.  Map 13a stands
2415=on its own.  Map 13b and Map13d _e, that's one map
2416=with technical corrections.  So I believe there's a
2417=total of eight maps.
2418=     Q    So the ones you just said, 13b and 13d_e,
2419=if I click on a hyperlink in your report, will it go
2420=to just one of those maps?
2421=     A    No.  There's two separate links.  And the
2422=links that they originally identify, should go to
2423=those plans.  The corrective versions I have created
2424=new links for.  I did it for the purposes of having
2425=the original and then having the corrective one, but
2426=I do consider those one plan.
2427=     Q    So just for this question, if we consider
2428=each time you made a new label for a map as a
2429=different map, do you know how many there were in
2430=this case?
2431=     A    I don't have that calculation, but I did
2432=offer the original maps:  13b, 13.5a, 13.5b, and map
2433=14 all had those corrections to the zero population,
2434=noncontiguous census blocks.
2435=     Q    So we're over ten at this point?
fmt=pb
2436=     A    So there would be the five plus the four
2437=so that's nine.  And then we have maps 13c, 13d, and
2438=map 13d_e.
2439=     Q    And then, at the preliminary injunction
2440=stage, you offered TN Apple Test 1 through 5, and TN
2441=Orange Test 1 through 5?
2442=     A    Those maps are illustrative.  Those came
2443=from an algorithm that created 60,000 maps.  Those
2444=were not maps that were drawn by hand.  It's a type
2445=of analysis that some social scientists and
2446=mathematicians use to give a representation of
2447=possibilities.  So that's what those set of plans
2448=were.  Those don't really fit in the same category
2449=as these other plans.
2450=     Q    Are they not as good?
2451=     A    They are certainly not as good because
2452=they were not drawn by hand.  I don't know anybody
2453=in redistricting who would rely on a computer to
2454=draw a plan.  Computers are inferior to human beings
2455=when it comes to drawing plans.
2456=     Q    Didn't you use a computer program to draw
2457=every one of these?
2458=     A    A computer program is different than
2459=having a computer draw a plan.
2460=     Q    Okay.  But you had a computer draw the
fmt=pb
2461=maps that you submitted to this Court at the
2462=preliminary injunction stage and signed an affidavit
2463=that it was your report and those were drawn by a
2464=computer?
2465=     A    I gave instruction to the computer
2466=algorithm to draw plans to try to reduce the number
2467=of county splits.  I was asked by Plaintiffs'
2468=counsel to determine if the state could have drawn
2469=plans that had fewer county splits than what they
2470=enacted.  That report is additional evidence that
2471=they could have drawn the plan.  Though, those plans
2472=are not great plans and are not plans that if I were
2473=special master that I would ask a Court to adopt.
2474=               I would not deliver those to my boss
2475=if I were a redistricting consultant in
2476=Pennsylvania.  And I would not suggest that the
2477=Tennessee legislature pass any of those maps without
2478=doing the kinds of things that redistricting
2479=analysis requires, such as VRA analyses or ensuring
2480=that everything is contiguous.
2481=               So keeping in mind that I was asked
2482=to do that on a very tight deadline, and we were
2483=asked because there was almost no time between --
2484=I'm sorry.  I don't know what all the legal terms
2485=are, summary judgment or temporary injunction.
fmt=pb
2486=There was very little time.  So I was asked to do a
2487=very quick analysis to see if it was possible.  And
2488=I was working with an undergraduate student that had
2489=expertise on the algorithm that was created by
2490=someone else and we drew these maps.
2491=               I mentioned the precincts are sort of
2492=larger geographies that have approximately 2000
2493=people in them, and they combine those to create
2494=districts.  And that's not a great way of doing it
2495=either because the precincts are noncontiguous, and
2496=they are quite large, meaning that it limits the
2497=possibility.  Again, those are just used as a
2498=demonstration that the state could have done
2499=something different.  They are not perfect plans.
2500=               I'll additionally say, there are no
2501=perfect plans.  There's lots of tradeoffs in
2502=redistricting.  The plans that I offer include
2503=different amounts of splits.  Some have 22, 24, 25.
2504=But the ultimate conclusion that the state could
2505=have drawn a plan with fewer splits, even using the
2506=criteria that they have stated and then they've
2507=added to after the fact, you can still draw a plan
2508=that complies with state law and federal law and
2509=draws fewer county splits.  My conclusion is
2510=unchanged.
fmt=pb
2511=     Q    Is that a legal conclusion?
2512=     A    Whether the plans actually adhere to all
2513=federal and state law, that's not my conclusion.
2514=     Q    But you just said that was your
2515=conclusion.
2516=     A    Well, if the enacted plan is compliant
2517=with the state law, then these plans are compliant
2518=with the state law.
2519=     Q    And those are legal conclusions?
2520=     A    I'm not a lawyer.  I am an expert on
2521=redistricting.  I understand redistricting law.  I
2522=have drawn plans for Courts.  Not one of my plans
2523=has ever been challenged.  So it's my opinion that
2524=these plans, at least assuming that the enacted plan
2525=does not violate federal law, that these plans also
2526=don't violate federal law.  I am not making a
2527=conclusion about whether the enacted plan is
2528=compliant with federal law just to be clear.
2529=     Q    We'll move on.  So you weren't
2530=specifically aware of any particular provisions of
2531=the Tennessee Constitution before engaging in this
2532=project?
2533=     A    I'm a redistricting expert nationwide.  I
2534=follow sometimes closely, sometimes less closely
2535=with the redistricting process.  I had never done a
fmt=pb
2536=lawsuit.  This is my first time ever testifying.
2537=And I have never participated in redistricting in
2538=Tennessee prior to this engagement.
2539=     Q    Okay.  So when I asked the question, you
2540=were not specifically aware of any particular
2541=provisions of the Tennessee Constitution before
2542=engaging in this project, your answer is no?
2543=     A    Specific provision in the state
2544=Constitution, no.
2545=     Q    Okay.  And I believe you testified earlier
2546=and you also said at your deposition that when you
2547=accepted this job, you looked up the constitutional
2548=rules in the NCSL book, you looked up the Tennessee
2549=house redistricting committee website, the Tennessee
2550=Constitution, and nothing else?
2551=     A    So, Tennessee Constitution, NCSL book I
2552=know just generally.  We use it in my class and we
2553=read it every year.  Then, there was the state house
2554=Guidelines.  I don't recall anything else.  I talked
2555=to counsel about what the law requires in Tennessee.
2556=               There's case law -- as there is case
2557=law probably on every issue.  I know redistricting
2558=better.  The case law on redistricting goes back to
2559=at least to 1962 Baker vs. Carr.  There's much less
2560=before that.  But I'm familiar with most of those
fmt=pb
2561=cases.  Do I know every single redistricting case
2562=that has ever happened?  Absolutely not.  I don't
2563=know that anybody on Earth has followed every single
2564=court case that has ever happened.
2565=     Q    Well, I'm not asking about everyone.  I'm
2566=asking just about what you looked at here.  And my
2567=understanding is that you testified that you only
2568=looked at the NCSL book, this book, right?
2569=     A    Yes, that's exactly the book I used.
2570=     Q    The Tennessee house redistricting website
2571=and the Tennessee Constitution and nothing else that
2572=you looked up, right?
2573=     A    And also the census data.
2574=     Q    Well, let's look at your deposition on
2575=Page 111 and Page 112, Tab 3.  If you'll look at
2576=line 16, could you read that line, please.
2577=     A    "Upon accepting this retainer, I looked up
2578=the constitutional" [unintelligible] "referenced in
2579=the NCSL book and on the Tennessee website
2580=pertaining to the Constitution."
2581=     Q    Okay.  And if you could on the flip the
2582=page for me, on line 10, you were asked the
2583=question, "Did you look at anything else besides the
2584=website and the NCSL red book to determine what the
2585=guidelines for redistricting would be in Tennessee?"
fmt=pb
2586=And what did you say?
2587=     A    The state Constitution.
2588=     Q    And then you were asked, "Anything else?"
2589=And then you said?
2590=     A    "No."
2591=     Q    So, when you were asked if you looked at
2592=anything besides the state Constitution, the NCSL
2593=red book, and the house Redistricting Committee
2594=website you answered no?
2595=     A    True.
2596=     Q    But today you just said you looked at
2597=census data and other things?
2598=     A    Well, I said that in my report actually.
2599=     Q    But in your deposition you didn't?
2600=     A    I'm not so sure you are asking the same
2601=question here.
2602=     Q    Let's look at the deposition again.  On
2603=line 10, "Did you look at anything else besides that
2604=website and the NCSL red book to determine what the
2605=guidelines for redistricting would be in Tennessee?"
2606=               And you said, "The state
2607=Constitution."
2608=               And then when you were asked,
2609="Anything else?"
2610=               You said, "No."
fmt=pb
2611=          MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, I'm going to place
2612=     an objection under using depositions for
2613=     impeachment.  The next question and answer
2614=     should be read concerning the data that he also
2615=     looked at.  When there's additional testimony
2616=     that clarifies, it should be read.  Could I
2617=     have us read 17 through 22 at this time?
2618=          CHIEF JUDGE:  In the interest of
2619=     completion, that should be done
2620=     contemporaneously.
2621=          MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, I would point
2622=     out the line 17 talks about the data, and that
2623=     doesn't have anything to do with the
2624=     guidelines, but he said he was looking up the
2625=     data for the guidelines.  So, to the extent
2626=     that he looked up the Census Bureau for data,
2627=     we'll stipulate to that, but that's not with
2628=     this says.
2629=          MR. TIFT:  Okay.  His previous question
2630=     asked, said that you didn't look at the data,
2631=     and this next one addresses the data he didn't
2632=     look at.  So, if they are not saying that he
2633=     didn't look at the data, then we don't need to
2634=     read that.
2635=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay, then.
fmt=pb
2636=     Q    (By Mr. Swatley) It's is it fair to say
2637=you didn't read a single Tennessee case before you
2638=started drawing maps here?
2639=     A    No, I did not read the Tennessee court
2640=cases, nor am I sure if I had access to them.
2641=     Q    Okay.  Do you believe that Plaintiffs'
2642=counsel has access to those cases?
2643=     A    Yes.  And I asked for their advice on what
2644=the Tennessee Law says as far as things that are not
2645=in the Constitution or in the state house
2646=guidelines.
2647=     Q    So did Plaintiffs' counsel give you the
2648=line that was from Lockert v. Crowell that you cited
2649=in your house report saying, "Cross as few county
2650=lines as necessary to comply with the Federal
2651=Constitution"?
2652=     A    Yes, I think that's right.
2653=     Q    Did they give you anything else?
2654=     A    As far as what?
2655=     Q    Legal advice.  They gave you advice on how
2656=it complied with the Law, right?
2657=     A    I asked counsel what the Law requires in
2658=Tennessee, and I read through court documents at the
2659=time, whatever I had available to me, to say what
2660=the challenges were.  I certainly didn't know going
fmt=pb
2661=in that Shelby County couldn't be split.
2662=     Q    But you do now?
2663=     A    There's an interpretation of a Court case
2664=that says that Shelby County cannot be split.  The
2665=Tennessee Constitution absolutely does not say that
2666=Shelby County cannot be split.
2667=     Q    Isn't it true that in federal
2668=redistricting, the criteria of the highest order are
2669=the ones mandated by federal law, and it's the one
2670=person, one vote and that race can't be predominant
2671=motive in drawing, it's true that those two are the
2672=criteria of the highest order?
2673=     A    So anything in the Federal Constitution is
2674=the highest order.  Anything that is found in
2675=federal law is right below that in the order.  And
2676=anything in state Constitution is below that.
2677=     Q    So, now that your opinion is based on what
2678=Plaintiffs' counsel says the legal standard is for
2679=county splits, but you didn't read it yourself, I
2680=have that accurate?
2681=     A    So Mr. Himes has summaries of the Lockert
2682=cases in his reports.  I have read all of those, but
2683=I did not read all of the record from those court
2684=cases.  I don't know that I have access.  I can't
2685=even find access to current dockets often.  So, no,
fmt=pb
2686=I did not read the whole docket for Lockert cases.
2687=     Q    So you relied on Plaintiffs' counsel, what
2688=they said the standard is and what Mr. Himes put in
2689=his report?
2690=     A    Among other things.  I have a generalized
2691=expertise in redistricting, as I said.  I cannot
2692=account for where I found every single thing I know
2693=in my entire life.
2694=     Q    I'm not asking you for that.  I'm asking
2695=specific to Tennessee.  You just said other things
2696=to what Plaintiffs' counsel told you.
2697=          CHIEF JUDGE:  I'm going to ask you to stop
2698=     interrupting the witness.  Let him finish.
2699=          MR. SWATLEY:  Yes, Your Honor.  I'm sorry.
2700=     Q    (By Mr. Swatley) Do you have more?
2701=     A    I cannot recall where I have received all
2702=my information for about every single law regarding
2703=Tennessee or any other law.  But what I will say is
2704=I have been provided with a substantial amount of
2705=information about what the Tennessee Law is, and
2706=there are certain circumstances in my illustrative
2707=plans where Defendants' experts have suggested that
2708=I have violated Tennessee Law, and I have made those
2709=corrections and landed eventually on plans 13c and
2710=13d, which apparently do not violate the Tennessee
fmt=pb
2711=Constitution as Defendant experts read those laws.
2712=               As I said in my rebuttal report, that
2713=I am not a lawyer.  I can read law.  I can read
2714=court cases.  I can interpret them.  But ultimately,
2715=the Court determines what is legal and what is not
2716=legal.
2717=     Q    So, back to one person, one vote and race
2718=not being the preponderant motive.  Are the words
2719=one person, one vote in the US Constitution?
2720=     A    They are not.
2721=     Q    Are the words race cannot be
2722=the preponderant motive in line drawing in the
2723=Constitution?
2724=     A    They are not.
2725=     Q    You only know those by reading US Supreme
2726=Court cases Reynolds v. Sims and Reno v. Shaw,
2727=right?
2728=     A    That's right.
2729=     Q    But you didn't read any Tennessee case
2730=yourself here before you started drawing?
2731=     A    I did not.
2732=     Q    You know an undergrad student by the name
2733=of Zach Griggy?
2734=     A    I do.
2735=     Q    And Zach Griggy is an undergrad student
fmt=pb
2736=and poly sci major at UC Irvine?
2737=     A    Yes.
2738=     Q    And how old is he?
2739=     A    Approximately -- he's graduating college
2740=in a month, so what's that?  About 22, 23.
2741=     Q    And Zach Griggy worked on these maps with
2742=you that you put in these reports?
2743=     A    He did.
2744=     Q    Do you typically rely on undergrad
2745=students to do your work?
2746=     A    To do my work?  I don't know how to answer
2747=that question.  That's -- Zach Griggy did not do my
2748=work.
2749=     Q    But he helped you with the substantive map
2750=drawing here?
2751=     A    I love to collaborate with people.  I
2752=often write peer-reviewed papers with co-authors.  I
2753=collaborate with my undergrad students often.  We do
2754=research together.  So I absolutely love to work
2755=with other people and including students.
2756=     Q    And you charged $200 an hour in this case,
2757=right?
2758=     A    I did.
2759=     Q    Did you charge for Mr. Griggy's time?
2760=     A    Mr. Griggy charges for his own time.
fmt=pb
2761=     Q    Did you bill that directly to the
2762=Plaintiff, or did you pay for that yourself?
2763=     A    The Plaintiffs paid that.
2764=     Q    So it's a separate line item?
2765=     A    Yes.
2766=     Q    And you drew all these maps using Dave's
2767=Redistricting?
2768=     A    With the qualification that the first set
2769=of maps were drawn with an algorithm that wasn't
2770=using Dave's Redistricting.
2771=     Q    But all the other maps were drawn using
2772=Dave's Redistricting?
2773=     A    Yes.
2774=     Q    And Mr. Griggy also used Dave's
2775=Redistricting?
2776=     A    Yeah, he's brilliant on it.
2777=     Q    And he's not the expert in this case?
2778=     A    He's not.
2779=     Q    And he didn't use any other program
2780=besides Dave's?
2781=     A    I can't be 100 percent certain that he
2782=wouldn't have used any other program for any
2783=purposes, but we used Dave's Redistricting for the
2784=purpose of drawing maps.
2785=     Q    He didn't use any program besides Dave's
fmt=pb
2786=to work on any of your maps that you have produced
2787=in this case?
2788=     A    As far as I know, absolutely not.  We
2789=always use Dave's Redistricting App, yes.
2790=     Q    Okay.  Do you know if he has access to any
2791=other map software besides Dave's Redistricting?
2792=     A    Well, there are a quantity of programs
2793=that are out in the public space that are free to
2794=use.  So we all have access to those.  He does not
2795=have a license for Maptitude as far as I am aware.
2796=     Q    Do you know if UC Irvine has a license for
2797=Maptitude?
2798=     A    I have no idea.
2799=     Q    And Zach Griggy is also a student of
2800=Bernie Grofman, your mentor?
2801=     A    That's right.
2802=     Q    Does Mr. Griggy collaborate often with
2803=Bernie Grofman?
2804=     A    He does.
2805=     Q    Do you know if Bernie Grofman has a
2806=license for Maptitude?
2807=     A    I can't speak for Bernie.  He's not here
2808=right now.  I don't believe he does.  We heard
2809=Mr. Himes testify earlier that when he worked with
2810=Mr. Grofman, they worked in Dave's Redistricting
fmt=pb
2811=App, and that's all I'll say about that.
2812=     Q    And you agree it's important for a
2813=self-proclaimed expert to use the best tools
2814=available?
2815=     A    I don't agree with that.
2816=     Q    You don't need to use the best tools
2817=available?
2818=     A    I would prefer to drive in the safest car
2819=in the world but I don't.  I drive in a car that's
2820=safe.  I drive in a car that gets me from A to B.
2821=               When I redistrict, I use the tools
2822=that are available to me that allow me to accomplish
2823=the job at hand.  And Dave's Redistricting is a
2824=suitable tool for the purpose of doing
2825=redistricting, as evidenced by the fact that it was
2826=used in New York by the special master, me, in
2827=drawing their congressional and state legislative
2828=districts.
2829=               It was used by the special masters,
2830=Mr. Himes and Dr. Grofman in Virginia when they were
2831=appointed special master to draw their congressional
2832=and state legislative districts.  It is a tool that
2833=is plenty sufficient for this task.
2834=     Q    Just to clarify, you are not an expert in
2835=driving a car, right?
fmt=pb
2836=     A    I hope I'm an expert in driving a car.
2837=     Q    Do you hold yourself out to this court as
2838=an expert qualified --
2839=          MR. TIFT:  We have gone pretty far field.
2840=     Obviously, he is not a car driving expert.
2841=          MR. SWATLEY:  But he opened the door to
2842=     it.
2843=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Objection sustained.
2844=     Q    (By Mr. Swatley) You are familiar with the
2845=various tools available in Dave's Redistricting?
2846=     A    I'm pretty familiar with the website, yes.
2847=     Q    Is Dave's easy to use?
2848=     A    I think the benefit of Dave's
2849=Redistricting App is that it is easy to use.
2850=     Q    Is it comprehensive?
2851=     A    Can you define comprehensive?
2852=     Q    Can you do all your work necessary in
2853=redistricting on Dave's Redistricting App?
2854=     A    I use almost no other tools in the process
2855=of drawing these maps.
2856=     Q    Okay.  And would you describe it as
2857=accurate?
2858=     A    Accurate in what terms?
2859=     Q    Is it accurate for when you were drawing
2860=redistricting plans, is it accurate given the data
fmt=pb
2861=that is in that program.
2862=     A    So, I'm going to assume you mean is the
2863=data underlying Dave's Redistricting App accurate.
2864=And I always verify that the data in Dave's matches
2865=the US Census data.  And I have never even once
2866=found a problem with it matching.
2867=     Q    Did you do that in this case, where you
2868=compared the data to what's in Dave's Redistricting
2869=App?
2870=     A    I did.
2871=     Q    And you have used Maptitude before?
2872=     A    I have used Maptitude when I did
2873=redistricting for the Federal Courts, and I used
2874=Maptitude in my capacity as redistricting consultant
2875=for the state of Pennsylvania.
2876=     Q    And is it easy to use?
2877=     A    I find it to be more difficult to use than
2878=DRA.  There is not as much data built into it.  It's
2879=not as user friendly.  With Dave's there's no
2880=support system.  With Maptitude, you pay a yearly
2881=fee in addition to your license, and that includes
2882=some technical support.  If I were to be hired by
2883=the Pennsylvania Commission in the next decade, I
2884=would not have paid for Maptitude in that next
2885=round.  I would use Dave's Redistricting instead.
fmt=pb
2886=     Q    Is Maptitude accurate?
2887=     A    I don't think we have had any problems
2888=with Maptitude in accuracy.  As Mr. Himes said, it
2889=is the gold standard.  A lot of States pay a lot of
2890=money to use that software.
2891=     Q    And I believe you testified yesterday that
2892=you made the decision to not pay $10,000 for the
2893=access to the Tennessee data here?
2894=     A    Yes.
2895=     Q    Did you ever ask Plaintiffs' counsel to
2896=pay for that?
2897=     A    I told the Plaintiffs' counsel what it
2898=would cost to get a license, and we talked about the
2899=tradeoffs between having the Maptitude program and
2900=being able to do it in DRA.  And we came to the
2901=conclusion that DRA was sufficient for the task at
2902=hand, as I have already stated.
2903=     Q    But yesterday you testified that you made
2904=the decision.  Did you make the decision after input
2905=from Plaintiffs' counsel?
2906=     A    I don't remember exactly how the decision
2907=was made.  I know we made the decision not to use
2908=Maptitude.
2909=     Q    Today you said you don't know how the
2910=decision was made, but yesterday you said that you
fmt=pb
2911=made the decision?
2912=     A    I don't know that I said I made the
2913=decision.  The decision was made, whether I made it
2914=or it was made.
2915=     Q    All right.  We'll move on.  Could I refer
2916=you to Exhibit 34.  Before that, do you remember the
2917=first time you used Dave's Redistricting App?
2918=     A    It's existed for decades.  I believe it
2919=was not very suitable prior to a few years ago when
2920=they made significant upgrades.  So I have been
2921=using it now for several years.  I don't know when I
2922=started.
2923=     Q    But you used it before 2020?
2924=     A    It was around 2020 when they made the
2925=significant upgrades.  The nickname of it on the
2926=website is DRA 2020.
2927=     Q    And when did you first use Maptitude?
2928=     A    It would have been 2017 or 2018.
2929=     Q    Okay.  So if you look at Exhibit 34, the
2930=maker of Maptitude is Caliper Corporation, right?
2931=     A    Yes.
2932=     Q    And if you flip to Page 2 on this, you
2933=have a quote on Maptitude's website.  Do you
2934=recognize this quote?
2935=     A    Yeah, I said that to them.
fmt=pb
2936=     Q    Could you please read your quote.
2937=     A    "There is an increasing large number of
2938=products on the market.  I have used several of them
2939=with mixed results.  Maptitude for redistricting is
2940=all-in-one easy to use, most accurate product
2941=available."
2942=     Q    And that's your picture?
2943=     A    That's me.
2944=     Q    And that's your name right there?
2945=     A    That's me with my title.
2946=     Q    And your employer?
2947=     A    Yes.
2948=     Q    But earlier you said Maptitude wasn't user
2949=friendly?
2950=     A    I said it's not as user friendly as DRA,
2951=and again, DRA has changed over time.
2952=     Q    When did you give this quote?
2953=     A    I don't remember.  It was a while ago.
2954=     Q    Would it have been 2021?
2955=     A    I will say it was before I used DRA as
2956=special master in New York.
2957=     Q    But you were familiar with DRA before you
2958=were special master in New York?
2959=     A    Yeah, I used it in my class.
2960=     Q    Did you receive any compensation in any
fmt=pb
2961=way for this quote?
2962=     A    No.
2963=     Q    And you decided after conferring with
2964=Plaintiffs' counsel to use Dave's Redistricting and
2965=not Maptitude here?
2966=     A    That's right.
2967=     Q    And you saved all your alternative maps in
2968=this case not on Dave's Redistricting, but you saved
2969=them this your computer as block files?
2970=     A    Or shapefiles.
2971=     Q    So some were saved as block and some saved
2972=as shapefiles?
2973=     A    And some of them as both.  I have files
2974=for all the plans under one of those two.
2975=     Q    But you never filed those files with the
2976=Court here?
2977=     A    I was never asked to.
2978=     Q    But you also never did it?
2979=          MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, objection for
2980=     clarification.  Of course, Dr. Cervas doesn't
2981=     file things with the Court.  The Plaintiffs do.
2982=     So, I don't know that he would have knowledge.
2983=     Q    (By Mr. Swatley) To your knowledge, you
2984=never requested Plaintiffs' counsel file these files
2985=with the Court?
fmt=pb
2986=     A    I don't know the process.  I delivered
2987=reports with links, thinking that that was the most
2988=transparent way of doing things.  If it was the
2989=wrong procedure, I regret that, but I feel very
2990=strongly in transparency.  When I delivered maps to
2991=the Supreme Court or New York, I gave them links to
2992=DRA in the identical fashion as I did in this case.
2993=     Q    Looking at your map 13a, you testified
2994=earlier that it eliminated a VRA protected, majority
2995=black district in West Tennessee?
2996=     A    Yes.
2997=     Q    And this majority rural black West
2998=Tennessee district was the subject of extensive
2999=federal litigation in the 1990s known as the Rural
3000=West Tennessee cases?
3001=     A    Yes, I was made familiar of that case.
3002=     Q    After you drew the map?
3003=     A    I believe so, yeah.
3004=     Q    And you did no VRA analysis in this case?
3005=     A    I was not hired to do a VRA analysis.
3006=     Q    And when you drew the map in New York, you
3007=hired someone else to do the VRA analysis?
3008=     A    As I was in my deposition, we are careful
3009=about what we are requesting of a VRA analysis.
3010=There's no such thing as a VRA analysis on a map
fmt=pb
3011=being drawn, right?  Maps are supposed to be drawn
3012=with race not as a predominant motive.  And then,
3013=the VRA requires that States not dilute the votes of
3014=protective groups.
3015=               And if a Plaintiff is challenging a
3016=map that was enacted as a VRA violation, then
3017=there's a set of tests known as the Gingles Test and
3018=the Totality of Circumstances Test that they would
3019=have to be proven.  So, if the state were to adopt
3020=one of my maps, then it would be subject to a
3021=potential VRA challenge.  But the state does not
3022=necessarily need to do some kind of VRA analysis
3023=ahead of time.
3024=               Retrogression, as I said yesterday,
3025=is one way that the state can avoid a VRA claim, by
3026=saying we haven't reduced the number of
3027=majority-minority districts.  Though that's clearly
3028=not necessarily enough.  The state needs to ensure
3029=it hasn't diluted the votes of its citizens.
3030=     Q    Okay.  So from what I understand, you just
3031=said that when you are enacted a map, they aren't
3032=expected to do the VRA analysis, but in this case in
3033=your report, you bemoan the fact that the Defendants
3034=didn't give you any VRA analysis.
3035=     A    I don't know if I bemoan the fact.  I say
fmt=pb
3036=that the Defendants did not give VRA analysis, and
3037=it appears as if the state did not do any kind of
3038=VRA analysis.  So to justify the drawing of a
3039=district, so if there's a justification, which the
3040=state seems to have suggested that there was a
3041=justification for drawing District 80, then you have
3042=to justify it based on a VRA analysis.
3043=               You can't just draw to a racial
3044=target and say, we think that there ought to be a
3045=district here that's some racial percentage.  That
3046=would be really pushing up against the Law when it
3047=comes to the Shaw v. Reno line of litigation that
3048=says you can't use race as a predominant motive.
3049=     Q    So, when you say it doesn't appear to you
3050=that the state didn't do any VRA analysis on these
3051=maps, is that speculation?
3052=     A    I was not provided with VRA analysis, and
3053=there was none provided on the state website.  So
3054=whether the state did or not, it was not made
3055=public.
3056=     Q    Okay.  So besides map 13a, this isn't the
3057=first time one of your maps has been questioned for
3058=potentially disenfranchising black voters?
3059=     A    You're going to have to tell me what you
3060=are referring to.
fmt=pb
3061=     Q    When you were special master in New
3062=York -- by the way, the New York Supreme Court is
3063=the Trial Court there, right?
3064=     A    That's right.
3065=     Q    So, the judge was from Steuben County?
3066=     A    That's right.
3067=     Q    So, you released a preliminary map of your
3068=New York congressional districts on February 16th of
3069=last year, correct?
3070=     A    Yes.
3071=     Q    And that preliminary map split two
3072=historically black neighborhoods in Brooklyn,
3073=Bed-Stuy, and Crown Heights?
3074=     A    That's right.
3075=     Q    All right.  And you corrected that on your
3076=final map that you submitted four days later, right?
3077=     A    Yeah.  I took public feedback in this
3078=process, and received thousands of emails and
3079=testimony from members of Congress from the
3080=political parties represented through counsel in a
3081=lawsuit.  And with that public feedback made changes
3082=subject to criticism.
3083=     Q    And your preliminary map there also of the
3084=seven black Congressmen in New York, it double
3085=bunked four of them?
fmt=pb
3086=     A    I have no idea.  I was not provided
3087=incumbency information.  There were newspapers that
3088=reported such thing.  Keeping in mind that in
3089=congressional districts in New York, no incumbent
3090=needs to live in their district.  And also, the New
3091=York Constitution in its plain language says that
3092=you cannot favor nor disfavor any incumbent.  So, I
3093=don't want to reveal private conversations I have
3094=had with judges on these court cases.  So, I'm going
3095=to not say anything else about that.
3096=     Q    That's fine.  Do you know if incumbents
3097=have to live in their districts in Tennessee?
3098=     A    I have been told that they do, but I
3099=haven't seen the actual language of the law.
3100=     Q    So, turning to your Tennessee Apple Test
3101=1, Tennessee Apple Test 3, Tennessee Apple Test 5,
3102=Tennessee Orange Test 1, Tennessee Orange Test 2,
3103=Cervas house map 13a, Cervas house map 13b, Cervas
3104=house map 14a, Cervas house map 13.5a, Cervas house
3105=map 13.5b, Cervas house map 13d, and Cervas house
3106=map 13d_e contain noncontiguous districts, correct?
3107=     A    You haven't told me where to turn to find
3108=these.
3109=     Q    Well, they are your maps.
3110=     A    I don't know all the details -- there were
fmt=pb
3111=60,000 maps that were created in that.  If the maps
3112=were discontiguous, it was because the precincts
3113=were discontiguous.
3114=     Q    Okay.  So, if any of your maps were
3115=discontiguous, including 13a, 13b, 13b_e, your
3116=testimony here is that if there was a noncontiguous
3117=census blocks, it's because the precinct was not
3118=contiguous?
3119=     A    That is not the testimony I said.  You
3120=asked me about specific plans that were generated by
3121=a computer, and that computer algorithm was
3122=instructed to keep all districts contiguous.  So,
3123=because they were building out of precincts, if the
3124=precinct was considered contiguous but it actually
3125=was not, then that would have caused the
3126=noncontiguity.
3127=               In the plans that I created by hand,
3128=we may have used precincts to build the plan, but
3129=the precincts themselves would not have been
3130=necessarily the cause of the noncontiguity.  I
3131=testified yesterday that I'm not sure what caused
3132=those noncontiguous.  And when I asked Dave's
3133=Redistricting App, the people who run that website,
3134=they were a little perplexed about what was causing
3135=that to happen.
fmt=pb
3136=     Q    So every time we see an e on one of your
3137=map labels, that stands for errata?
3138=     A    That is correct.
3139=     Q    Earlier I believe you testified that you
3140=found the noncontiguities in 13b_e, 14a_e, 13.5a_e,
3141=and 13.5d_e, right?
3142=     A    Those maps are the corrections, yes.
3143=     Q    And the Dave's Redistricting tool for
3144=finding noncontiguities was not working at that time
3145=correctly?
3146=     A    Again, I contacted the folks at DRA to say
3147=that we were continuing to have this problem, where
3148=even though the maps were being built as contiguous
3149=that it was causing these noncontiguous census
3150=blocks and we couldn't figure firing out why.  And
3151=the tool was not identifying them, which prompted
3152=them to look into the situation and then rewrite
3153=that tool.
3154=     Q    So you were able to find the
3155=noncontiguities in those four maps but not in 13d or
3156=13d_e?
3157=     A    Well, I didn't find those noncontiguities.
3158=Defendants' experts found them, listed them in their
3159=depositions or reports.  And then I went and
3160=identified where they were based on their geo ID.
fmt=pb
3161=     Q    And you earlier heard Mr. Trende's
3162=testimony, correct?
3163=     A    I did.
3164=     Q    And you recalled that he said he didn't
3165=use Dave's to find the noncontiguities, he used R
3166=statistical analysis?
3167=     A    He did testify to that.
3168=     Q    Do you know how to do an R statistical
3169=analysis?
3170=     A    R is a computer program that does
3171=statistical analysis.
3172=     Q    Is that computer program $10,000?
3173=     A    That is an open-source software, so.
3174=     Q    So it's free?
3175=     A    Can I finish?
3176=     Q    I'm sorry.
3177=     A    So, keeping in mind that it's a free piece
3178=of software, but all it is is a program by which
3179=somebody can write programs that can do other
3180=things.  Okay.  So you cannot find noncontiguities
3181=in R without some program or function loaded into
3182=it.  I do not know what program Mr. Trende uses.  I
3183=do not use R to do redistricting.
3184=     Q    But there are ways to find noncontiguities
3185=without spending $10,000?
fmt=pb
3186=     A    If one wanted to, you could go through
3187=every one of the 179,000 census blocks and identify
3188=the noncontiguities with unlimited time.  I know
3189=that people have developed programs in R that do
3190=these kinds of things.  I don't know how to operate
3191=that particular software.
3192=               I actually have tried and the
3193=computer programming that I know, that I believe Mr.
3194=Trende uses, because he used it in his testimony in
3195=New York is called Redist.  I have attempted to use
3196=that.  It's written in something that's called
3197=tidyverse.  It's something that I don't use;
3198=therefore, I don't use that software.
3199=     Q    And you agree that contiguous districts
3200=was one of the statutory requirements in TCA
3201=3-1-103, the enacted house plan?
3202=     A    Contiguity is typically one of the
3203=required criteria in every state.
3204=     Q    Okay.  And you read the Tennessee
3205=Constitution, right?
3206=     A    Right.
3207=     Q    You testified to that earlier.  Did you
3208=see the part where Article 2, Section 5 says that
3209=you have to have contiguous multicounty districts?
3210=     A    Yes.
fmt=pb
3211=     Q    If we could look at your rebuttal report
3212=real quick.  I believe it is Tab 9, Page 2, footnote
3213=2.  Could you please read footnote 2 of Page 2?
3214=     A    "Several of Tennessee's counties are
3215=themselves noncontiguous, e.g., Davidson.  This
3216=makes detecting noncontiguity blocks more
3217=difficult."
3218=     Q    None of the blocks identified in any of
3219=your maps that were noncontiguous were these blocks,
3220=were they?
3221=     A    No.  Again, this is simply saying that a
3222=program like DRA would have to tell its software or
3223=any of the programs in R or anywhere else would have
3224=to say that even though that census block or set of
3225=census blocks isn't actually contiguous, that
3226=because of Tennessee Law, we are going to treat them
3227=as contiguous, or because of the guidelines that the
3228=house adopted.
3229=     Q    Right.  But that particular quirk is not
3230=the reason that your census blocks were
3231=noncontiguous?
3232=     A    The island districts in the counties were
3233=not associated with mine.  What I'm saying in that
3234=footnote is that because there are these quirks, it
3235=means that software has to be written correctly to
fmt=pb
3236=identify those, including Maptitude or Dave's
3237=Redistricting or any other software.
3238=     Q    And you agree now that all it takes to
3239=find a noncontiguous district in Dave's
3240=Redistricting App is to click a mouse twice?
3241=     A    Again, computer programs sometimes have
3242=problems, but it appears based on the maps I have
3243=developed for this case in which I have tested DRA,
3244=that they have now fixed that problem that allows
3245=you to identify these noncontiguous districts in a
3246=quite easy and visually satisfying way actually.
3247=     Q    So just to be clear, you chose a software
3248=that had a persistent statistical flaw?
3249=     A    I did not know at the time.
3250=     Q    Okay.  If we could look at your March 6th,
3251=2023 Affidavit.  I believe it is Tab 85.  So Tab 85
3252=is your first report you produced in this case; is
3253=that accurate?
3254=     A    So it's the March 29th, 2022 report?
3255=     Q    Okay.
3256=          MR. TIFT:  If I could just clarify, you
3257=     stated March 6th.
3258=     Q    (By Mr. Swatley) I apologize.  I told you
3259=to look at the wrong one.  We should be looking at
3260=Tab 87, so just a couple more flips.  This is your
fmt=pb
3261=affidavit that you filed on March 6 of 2023,
3262=correct?
3263=     A    I don't see a date on it, but it is an
3264=affidavit that I filed.
3265=     Q    And on Page 2, under No. 4, I believe five
3266=or six lines down, you stated that a persistent
3267=software flaw on DRA related to contiguity had been
3268=remedied?
3269=     A    Yes.
3270=          MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, I would like to
3271=     move Exhibit 87 into evidence.
3272=          MR. TIFT:  No objection.
3273=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibit 87 is admitted into
3274=     evidence.
3275=                              (The above-referred to
3276=                              document was thereupon
3277=                              marked Defendant Exhibit
3278=                              No. 87, and is attached
3279=                              hereto.)
3280=     Q    (By Mr. Swatley) Do you know roughly what
3281=day this was solved?
3282=     A    It was sometime after the New Year.  Their
3283=team had went away for Christmas.  I don't know
3284=exactly what day.  It was sometime in the future.  I
3285=don't know what day.
3286=     Q    Okay.  And you agree that you drew your
3287=map 13d_e, the data on your supplemental report is
fmt=pb
3288=January 9th, 2023?
3289=     A    That sounds correct, yes.
3290=     Q    When did you learn of this persistent
3291=software flaw with Dave's?
3292=     A    Well, I learned of it through this court
3293=case and the fact that we continued to have these
3294=contiguity issues.  I wasn't at the time aware that
3295=it was the software.  At the beginning I thought it
3296=was an error that I had made, and I was regretful of
3297=those errors.  And later learned that there was
3298=something in the software that was either causing
3299=these census blocks to be assigned wrong in the
3300=program or something that when we were combining the
3301=precincts it was doing it automatically and failed
3302=to alert us to that fact.
3303=               So, the software flaw probably has --
3304=it's like any computer program.  They have to be
3305=updated constantly when you learn about problems.
3306=And this is just another issue that was there that
3307=they fixed.  This is a feature of the DRA that you
3308=can find your noncontiguous blocks real simply with
3309=that tool only if it works.
3310=               In New York, we didn't have this
3311=problem.  But the difference between New York and
3312=Tennessee appears to be that in New York all the
fmt=pb
3313=precincts are contiguous.  And in Tennessee, they
3314=are not.
3315=     Q    And do you know if these contiguous
3316=precincts in Tennessee correlate with any of the
3317=census blocks that you left noncontiguous?
3318=     A    I didn't check.  When I asked DRA or
3319=suggested there might be something wrong, they
3320=thought it might have to do with that.  But I think
3321=even as sit here today, no one was positive what was
3322=causing that to happen in DRA.  My understanding is
3323=that they remedied it by re-writing the algorithm to
3324=do some other procedure for identifying these
3325=things.
3326=     Q    And that one census block right there that
3327=you looked at earlier on the Plaintiffs'
3328=demonstrative, that's a contiguous census blocks?
3329=     A    Contiguous to what?
3330=     Q    Your example yesterday, you could start
3331=walking in that census block and walk to anywhere
3332=else in that census block without leaving that
3333=census block?
3334=     A    I believe every census block in America
3335=are all contiguous within themselves.  They are the
3336=smallest level of geography.
3337=     Q    Let's go back to your October house
fmt=pb
3338=report.  I believe it is Tab 8.  And on Page 11,
3339=footnote 6, you stated that more restrictive
3340=population deviation standards would require a
3341=tradeoff that would, in effect, increase the number
3342=of county splits.
3343=     A    I would have to read what text it's
3344=referring to.  But, yeah, I mean, that is true.  If
3345=one wanted to have every district have exactly equal
3346=population standard of the US congressional district
3347=standard, you would have to have close to 98 county
3348=splits.
3349=     Q    So you trade off lower population
3350=deviation for more county splits?
3351=     A    Lower population deviation typically means
3352=more -- that's the whole reasoning behind the
3353=Reynolds v. Sims, allowing the States to have the 10
3354=percent overall deviation.
3355=     Q    Okay.  So if you could flip to Page 19 of
3356=that report, the second to last sentence at the
3357=bottom starting with "The Tennessee Constitution"
3358=could you please read that sentence.
3359=     A    "The Tennessee Constitution guides
3360=legislature to limit the harm to political
3361=subdivisions and in particular, counties by
3362=prohibiting splits, unless necessary to comply with
fmt=pb
3363=conflicting state or federal law."
3364=     Q    Okay.  And then, if you could flip to Page
3365=7 of the same report.  Do you see at the bottom of
3366=the Roman numeral IV background, the last sentence
3367=there, and here you quote the Lockert v. Crowell
3368=case.  And could you read that quote, please.
3369=     A    "Cross as few county lines as necessary to
3370=comply with the Federal Constitution."
3371=     Q    Why does your county splitting standard
3372=change in the same report?
3373=     A    What do you mean standard change?
3374=     Q    Well, on Page 19, it says, "prohibiting
3375=splits, unless necessary to comply with conflicting
3376=state or federal law."  But here you say, "Cross as
3377=few county lines as necessary to comply with the
3378=Federal Constitution."  Which one is it?
3379=     A    I'm not sure that those are contradictory.
3380=One just includes more.
3381=     Q    Okay.  Well, which one is the standard?
3382=     A    Well, that's a legal question.  But the
3383=Federal Constitution is always the most important
3384=thing no matter what.
3385=     Q    But you answer, when I asked you what the
3386=standard is, is that that's a legal question?
3387=     A    What is the standard?
fmt=pb
3388=     Q    That you said in your report.
3389=     A    Well, the legal standard as quoted is
3390="Cross as few county lines as necessary to comply
3391=with the Federal Constitution."
3392=     Q    But you said something different on Page
3393=19?
3394=     A    So it says "conflicting state or federal
3395=law."  So state law would actually not take
3396=precedence over the state Constitution.  The state
3397=Constitution would be before statutory state law.
3398=But there might be other provisions of the state
3399=Constitution that it conflicts with, and then it's
3400=up to the Court to decide which one is more
3401=important.
3402=     Q    All right.  Let's talk briefly about your
3403=senate maps in this case.  Your senate report is Tab
3404=7.  Now, you recognize this as your senate report?
3405=     A    Yes.
3406=     Q    And you drew three alternate reports here,
3407=correct?
3408=     A    I drew one map with two alternatives to
3409=that map.
3410=     Q    And you submitted this report in October
3411=of 2022?
3412=     A    October 10th, 2022.
fmt=pb
3413=     Q    And that was after you were aware that the
3414=enacted senate plan would be used for the 2022
3415=elections?
3416=     A    I believe that -- and forgive me, a lot of
3417=things go on in the course of a year.  I have had
3418=several jobs.  But this particular senate map was
3419=originally ruled under preliminary injunction, but
3420=that was overturned by the state Supreme Court.  And
3421=because there was not enough time to have a full
3422=trial, the Court had said that they were going to
3423=allow the enacted plan to be used in 2022.
3424=     Q    So when you drew this report, you knew
3425=that these plans could not go into effect until at
3426=the earliest the 2024 election?
3427=     A    I guess that's true, yes.
3428=     Q    And you are aware that because the senate
3429=has staggered terms that a byproduct of
3430=redistricting is that some create six-year voters
3431=and some create two-year voters?
3432=     A    The state senate in Tennessee is exactly
3433=the same as the state senate in Pennsylvania with a
3434=different number of Senators.
3435=     Q    So, you are familiar that because of
3436=redistricting depending on the year when the senate
3437=voters are switched from an even to an odd or odd to
fmt=pb
3438=even, they map end up voting in two years or not
3439=vote for a Senator for six years, correct?
3440=     A    It's normal in redistricting.  People have
3441=to move between districts.  If population changes in
3442=differences across the state, some voters are going
3443=to end up in different districts than they were
3444=previously, and that includes being sometimes an
3445=odd, sometimes an even.  It's unavoidable.
3446=     Q    And you would agree that if there was a
3447=remedial map that this senate planned, there's the
3448=potential that a voter would have been moved from an
3449=odd to an even to an odd district, making them an
3450=eight-year voter?
3451=     A    Well, unfortunately, with redistricting
3452=that's the consequence.  If the state had enacted a
3453=legal map to begin with, those voters would not have
3454=been harmed.  But the voters are harmed now, now
3455=that they are only entitled to a remedy, which is,
3456=in this case, sequentially numbered districts inside
3457=of Davidson County.
3458=     Q    Do you know if any of your maps would
3459=create eight-year voters if they were adopted --
3460=     A    I do not know.  My maps are going to be
3461=different than the enacted map by necissity, because
3462=the enacted map is unconstitutional.
fmt=pb
3463=     Q    So you are saying the lines have to be
3464=different to be constitutional?
3465=     A    I don't have an opinion on that.  The
3466=numbers have to be different.
3467=     Q    And you agree in your senate report on the
3468=bottom of Page 6, you testified that you made
3469=efforts to avoid placing an incumbent who has two
3470=years left on their term in a district, where they
3471=would need to run for reelection early, though
3472=there's no mandate in the Tennessee Constitution to
3473=do so; is that correct?
3474=     A    Yes.  Whether I was successful at that, I
3475=don't know, because I wasn't provided information on
3476=where the incumbents live.
3477=     Q    And your testimony is also that your plans
3478=here were the most narrowly tailored redrawing of
3479=the Legislature's chosen lines?
3480=     A    I don't want the say that it's the most
3481=narrowly tailored.  I said it's narrowly tailored.
3482=In plan one, without any A or B, was a minimal
3483=amount that can be done.  There are lots of
3484=definitions of minimal.  Just see the Wisconsin
3485=Supreme Court case from last year.  But this is a
3486=very, very minimal change, narrowly tailored to
3487=correct the constitutional violation.
fmt=pb
3488=               And that said, there are probably
3489=lots of ways to correct the constitutional
3490=violation.  The point was this is one way, and my
3491=evidence shows the state could have done something
3492=different.  The state can choose to remedy the
3493=situation however they like.
3494=     Q    Right.  But we have had an election since
3495=then, and that changes due to staggered terms the
3496=nature of how changes must be made to comply with
3497=the laws, correct?
3498=     A    That is beyond the purview of my expert
3499=report.
3500=     Q    And would you agree that no court in the
3501=country has ever allowed an eight-year voter?
3502=     A    I have absolutely no idea on that
3503=question.
3504=     Q    Okay.  You agree that in your deposition
3505=you testified that your expressly disavow making any
3506=opinion that the General Assembly acted in bad
3507=faith?
3508=     A    Say that one more time.
3509=     Q    You expressly disavow making any opinion
3510=that the General Assembly acted in bad faith
3511=enacting the house map.
3512=     A    We are back on the house map now?
fmt=pb
3513=     Q    Yes.
3514=     A    I stated in my deposition and I believe in
3515=some of my reports that I believe, my expert opinion
3516=is, that the state did not provide a good-faith
3517=effort to reduce the number of county splits in the
3518=enacted plan.
3519=     Q    And the reason that you did that on Page
3520=19 of your October house report was for not
3521=splitting Shelby County correctly; is that correct?
3522=     A    You are going to have to flip me to the
3523=page.
3524=     Q    Tab 8, Page 19, last paragraph.
3525=     A    Sure.  So would you like me to read the
3526=quote from Reynolds v. Sims that talks about good
3527=faith here?
3528=     Q    Sure.
3529=     A    "By holding that as a federal
3530=constitutional requisite both houses of state
3531=legislature must be apportioned on the population
3532=basis.  We mean the Equal Protection Clause of the
3533=14th Amendment requires that a state make an honest
3534=and good-faith effort to construct districts in both
3535=houses of its legislature as nearly as equal as is
3536=practicable."
3537=     Q    Could you read the next sentence?
fmt=pb
3538=     A    "In over populating each district in
3539=Shelby County, the legislature has not given a
3540=good-faith effort to balance the constitutional
3541=criteria in state and federal law."
3542=     Q    So Reynolds v. Sims has to do with
3543=malapportionment, correct?
3544=     A    That's right.
3545=     Q    And you are not a lawyer?
3546=     A    I am not a lawyer.
3547=     Q    Can you tell me the legal meaning of good
3548=faith?
3549=     A    Nope.
3550=     Q    What about the legal meaning of honest?
3551=     A    I cannot.
3552=     Q    Okay.  So, you accused the Legislative
3553=Branch of the state of Tennessee of not giving a
3554=good-faith effort, because they did not split Shelby
3555=County?
3556=     A    In saying in this report that I had
3557=developed two plans that do split Shelby County,
3558=they reduced the average population variance in the
3559=plan so that consistent with the words here, that
3560=population is as nearly as equal as practicable,
3561=that even with the competing interest in the state
3562=Constitution that counties not be divided, that the
fmt=pb
3563=enacted plan does not satisfy the federal
3564=requirement of equal population.
3565=               And therefore, I do not believe that
3566=it was a good-faith effort under my definition of
3567=good faith.  In my opinion that they did not give a
3568=good faith to comply with federal law.  And if the
3569=justification was that the Tennessee Constitution
3570=requires counties need not be split unless necessary
3571=to comply with federal law, it's not justified by
3572=the actions of the legislature.
3573=     Q    You agree that there's no claim here for
3574=violation of one person, one vote or population
3575=deviation?
3576=     A    I'm aware that there's not.
3577=     Q    And you didn't know in your deposition
3578=whether there was a requirement to not split urban
3579=counties in Tennessee, did you?
3580=     A    As I said, I did not read those cases, and
3581=the Constitution doesn't explicitly say that.  Well,
3582=there is a provision in the Constitution that says
3583=you cannot split counties.  So again, going back to
3584=Baker v. Carr, no counties were split at all.  And
3585=so as I have said on numerous occasions today,
3586=counsel has provided me with what they understand to
3587=be the Law, and I used that in conjunction with the
fmt=pb
3588=text of the Constitution to draw these illustrative
3589=maps.
3590=     Q    So on the top of your Conclusion there on
3591=Page 19 of your October house report, it states that
3592=you were initially asked by Plaintiffs' counsel to
3593=keep Shelby County districts whole and not split
3594=Shelby County?
3595=     A    That's right.  That's why we have the 13
3596=series maps.
3597=     Q    And earlier you testified that Shelby
3598=County can split 13 or 14 house districts without
3599=being split?
3600=     A    I have said that.
3601=     Q    And either way keeps the overall
3602=population deviation of the entire map within 10
3603=percent?
3604=     A    The overall population deviation can stay
3605=within 10 percent.  That is right.
3606=     Q    And referring back really quick to your
3607=March 22 report, in that you provided a table where
3608=you stated what the ideal district number for Shelby
3609=County is, correct?
3610=     A    The ideal is the same anywhere in the
3611=state.
3612=          MR. TIFT:  I'm sorry.  Which are we
fmt=pb
3613=     referring to?
3614=          MR. SWATLEY:  We'll go back real quick.
3615=     Q    (By Mr. Swatley) Let's go to the Tab 85.
3616=Look at Page 4, Table 1.
3617=     A    So I list in Table 1 here that Shelby
3618=County has a population of 929,744.
3619=     Q    And the ideal district's number for Shelby
3620=County?
3621=     A    So if you divide this by the State's
3622=ideal, so the ideal population of the state is
3623=69,806.  So if you divide the population of Shelby
3624=County by the population of a single house district,
3625=there can fit 13.32 districts in Shelby County.
3626=     Q    And for the record, 13.32 is closer to 13
3627=than 14, isn't it?
3628=     A    You want me to do rounding?  13.32 is
3629=larger than 13 and smaller than 14.
3630=     Q    But it's closer to 13 than it is to 14?
3631=     A    I have opined in these reports saying that
3632=when you create 13 whole districts, it creates an
3633=average population of the Shelby County districts of
3634=some number.  And then, when you divide it by 14, it
3635=gives you some other number.  And when you split the
3636=county and include population from the surrounding
3637=county, it gives you a number that's much closer to
fmt=pb
3638=equal.
3639=          MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, I request to
3640=     strike that answer as non-responsive.  I'll
3641=     repeat my question.
3642=          CHIEF JUDGE:  I'm not going to strike it.
3643=     Q    (By Mr. Swatley) Is it closer to 13 or 14,
3644=13.32?
3645=     A    It's closer to 13.
3646=     Q    And looking at this March report, just
3647=flipping to Page 1.
3648=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Counsel, at a convenient
3649=     spot -- I don't want the stop your flow --
3650=     we'll take a lunch break.
3651=          MR. SWATLEY:  Okay.  I'm really close,
3652=     Your Honor.
3653=     Q    (By Mr. Swatley) Right under Introduction,
3654=the first words you put in the report in this case,
3655=could you read it for me?
3656=     A    We're on Page 1 of the March 29th exhibit,
3657="Counsel has asked me to prepare a report after
3658=creating demonstrative plans adhering to the
3659=following criteria."
3660=     Q    What is No. 1?
3661=     A    "Shelby County should have exactly 13 or
3662=14 house districts.  No portion of Shelby County
fmt=pb
3663=should be combined with any adjacent county in
3664=creating a district."
3665=     Q    Did Plaintiffs' counsel give you these
3666=instructions without giving an honest and good-faith
3667=effort, or did they give you these because it is the
3668=law?
3669=     A    They gave me these instructions because
3670=the state claimed that they were not allowed to
3671=split Shelby County.
3672=     Q    And you were testified earlier that you
3673=followed the instructions of Plaintiffs' counsel?
3674=     A    I did deliver maps 13a, 13b and map 14a
3675=following that No 1.
3676=          MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, just a minute to
3677=     confer with counsel.
3678=                    [Thereupon, a discussion off
3679=                    record was had.]
3680=
3681=          MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, I think now may
3682=     be a good time to take a break for lunch.  We
3683=     may have just a few more questions.
3684=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.  I'm not trying to
3685=     rush your questioning by any stretch.  I want
3686=     you to feel completely unrushed.
3687=                       - - -
3688=                    [12:47 P.M., a recess was had
3689=                    until 2:00 P.M.]
fmt=pb
3690=
3691=          CHIEF JUDGE:  You may proceed.
3692=          MR. SWATLEY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
3693=     Q    (By Mr. Swatley) Dr. Cervas, we are back
3694=after lunch.  You understand you are still under
3695=oath and all the same rules still apply?
3696=     A    Yes.
3697=     Q    All right.  I would like to start off by
3698=referring you to Tab No. 13.  It's Exhibit 13.
3699=          MR. SWATLEY:  It has been agreed upon,
3700=     Your Honor.
3701=     Q    (By Mr. Swatley) Dr. Cervas, do you
3702=recognize this screenshot?
3703=     A    This is Dave's Redistricting App.
3704=     Q    What is the map label at the top?
3705=     A    "TN house 13d_e."
3706=          MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, since this is
3707=     agreed upon by the parties, I would like to
3708=     move this into evidence.
3709=          MR. TIFT:  No objection.
3710=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibit 13 is admitted into
3711=     evidence without objection.
3712=                              (The above-referred to
3713=                              document was thereupon
3714=                              marked Defendant Exhibit
3715=                              No. 13, and is attached
3716=                              hereto.)
fmt=pb
3717=     Q    (By Mr. Swatley) And do you notice the
3718=toolbar symbolized by a crossed wrench and hammer in
3719=the top, left corner?
3720=     A    Yes.
3721=     Q    And you notice how it's clicked to pull
3722=down the various tools available?
3723=     A    Yes, sir.
3724=     Q    And you notice how two rows down it says
3725=the words "Find unassigned precincts"?
3726=     A    Yes.
3727=     Q    And one below it, it says Find
3728=noncontiguous districts"?
3729=     A    Yes, sir.
3730=     Q    You realize it's black.  Do you know what
3731=means?
3732=     A    When they are grayed out, that means
3733=there's nothing to find.
3734=     Q    And the find noncontiguous is black
3735=symbolizing there is something to find?
3736=     A    That is correct.
3737=     Q    Okay.  So, what this means, based on your
3738=understanding of Dave's Redistricting is that this
3739=map has noncontiguous districts?
3740=     A    Yes.  This is the algorithm we talked
3741=about earlier that they have corrected.
fmt=pb
3742=     Q    All right.  Do you know when I took this
3743=screenshot?
3744=     A    I have no idea.  I know this map was not
3745=delivered until after January 7th or 9th, so it
3746=would have been after that.
3747=     Q    All right.  And I would like you real
3748=quick to flip to Tab 30.  And do you recognize this
3749=to be a screenshot of Dave's Redistricting of the TN
3750=2022 state house map?
3751=     A    Yes.
3752=     Q    And we have been referring to that map as
3753=the house plan?
3754=     A    Yes.
3755=          MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, this has also
3756=     been agreed upon.  I would like to move this
3757=     into evidence, as well.
3758=          MR. TIFT:  No objection.
3759=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibit 30 is admitted into
3760=     evidence without objection.
3761=                              (The above-referred to
3762=                              document was thereupon
3763=                              marked Defendant Exhibit
3764=                              No. 30, and is attached
3765=                              hereto.)
3766=     Q    (By Mr. Swatley) And you'll notice that
3767=the same toolbar is displayed here?
3768=     A    Right.
fmt=pb
3769=     Q    And three lines down it says, "Find
3770=noncontiguous districts."
3771=     A    That's correct.
3772=     Q    And it's grayed out?
3773=     A    That's right.
3774=     Q    And that symbolizes that there are no
3775=noncontiguous districts according to that?
3776=     A    That's right.
3777=     Q    We'll move on.  Dr. Cervas, of all the
3778=maps you have created here for the house, which map
3779=is your best map?
3780=     A    I actually said earlier today that there
3781=are no perfect maps.  Best is not a quantity that
3782=can be defined in redistricting.
3783=     Q    If you had to pick one of your maps to be
3784=the new map of the ones you have created here, which
3785=one would you pick?
3786=     A    I'm sorry.  I would have to know what
3787=capacity I'm serving in.  There's no way for me to
3788=pick a best map.
3789=     Q    Well, let's assume you are special master,
3790=but you have to pick one of the maps you have
3791=created in this case, and you follow the guidance
3792=that you have stated on Page 2 of your October house
3793=report stating that all your maps comply with state
fmt=pb
3794=and federal laws, just off that criteria complying
3795=with the Law to your understanding, what map would
3796=you pick?
3797=     A    I would have to consult with the Court on
3798=that.  There is no best map.  And I'm not sure I
3799=would pick any of these sets of maps.  These are
3800=illustrative maps as evidence that the state did not
3801=create a plan that has as few as possible county
3802=splits.
3803=               The best plan or plan that I would
3804=submit to the Court would be in coordination with
3805=the Court on what the objective was.  The fact that
3806=I have seven different plans that do seven different
3807=things suggest that there are trading off options.
3808=The overall evidence that I have given is that all
3809=of these options have far fewer splits than the
3810=enacted plan.
3811=     Q    Your testimony was that you would not pick
3812=any of the maps that are in any of your reports in
3813=this case?
3814=     A    I did not say I wouldn't.  I said I'm not
3815=sure.
3816=               And you asked which was the best, and
3817=I am saying that there are tradeoffs.  And
3818=determining what is best is impossible unless you
fmt=pb
3819=determine what the tradeoffs are.
3820=     Q    Towards the end here.  I will refer you
3821=back to Tab 8.  It is your October house report.
3822=I'll refer you back to Page 19.
3823=               So, Dr. Cervas, you agree that the
3824=only time you use the words good faith in any of
3825=your expert reports submitted in this case is to
3826=quote the language from Reynolds v. Sims and then to
3827=say, "In overpopulating each district in Shelby
3828=County, the legislature has not given a good-faith
3829=effort to balance the constitutional criteria in
3830=state and federal law."
3831=     A    I'll say that I said that in this document
3832=there.  I can't tell you whether I said it anywhere
3833=else.  I simply don't remember.
3834=     Q    If I said, I don't see the words good
3835=faith anywhere else, do you have any reason to doubt
3836=that?
3837=     A    No.  In my deposition, I'm almost certain
3838=I did use the words good faith in saying that this
3839=legislature did not use good faith.
3840=     Q    Okay.  And if I ask you the legal meaning
3841=of good faith, as you testified earlier, you still
3842=do not know that?
3843=     A    No.  I was saying that in my capacity as
fmt=pb
3844=an expert.  I was asked whether something was good
3845=faith, and I was giving my opinion on whether
3846=something was good faith.
3847=     Q    In your report, you said the legislature
3848=had not given a good-faith effort in overpopulating
3849=each district in Shelby County?
3850=     A    The words here are what I said, right.
3851=     Q    Okay.  And earlier you admitted that at
3852=the time you submitted this October report, you had
3853=not read Lockert II?
3854=     A    In full, no, I had not read Lockert II.
3855=     Q    In your expert opinion based on your
3856=report here, as it pertains to the county splitting
3857=issue, is your expert opinion in your report based
3858=on the standard of splitting as few counties as
3859=possible?
3860=     A    I was retained by Plaintiffs' counsel to
3861=determine whether it was possible to draw a plan for
3862=the house that had fewer splits than the enacted
3863=plan while complying with federal and state law.
3864=     Q    And so your goal in drawing these maps was
3865=to split as few counties as possible?
3866=     A    In my capacity as expert here, we were
3867=attempting to draw plans that split as few counties
3868=as possible.
fmt=pb
3869=     Q    Have you read Lincoln County v. Crowell?
3870=     A    I have not read that court case.
3871=          MR. SWATLEY:  No more questions.  I will
3872=     pass the witness.
3873=          MR. TIFT:  Just one second, Your Honor.
3874=                       - - -
3875=
3876=REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. TIFT:
3877=     Q    Dr. Cervas, to start off, you just
3878=testified that you believe you discussed good faith
3879=in your deposition; is that correct?
3880=     A    Yes.
3881=     Q    What do you recall saying about good faith
3882=in your deposition?
3883=     A    I believe I was asked about whether, if I
3884=recall, whether the legislature acted in bad faith.
3885=And I don't remember exactly the words.  I would
3886=have to go to the deposition, but I said that they
3887=did not act in good faith.
3888=     Q    Would it help to review your deposition to
3889=help you refresh your recollection?
3890=     A    That would be great.
3891=     Q    I will direct you to your deposition,
3892=which is Tab 3.  And once you get to Tab 3, I'll
3893=direct you to Page 131.  And you can read it to
fmt=pb
3894=yourself starting with that final paragraph that
3895=starts with "My conclusion" and see if that
3896=refreshes your recollection concerning what you
3897=testified at your deposition.
3898=     A    (Witness complies.)
3899=     Q    Have you read that?
3900=     A    I have.
3901=     Q    All right.  And does that refresh your
3902=recollection on what you testified about good faith
3903=at your deposition?
3904=     A    Yes.
3905=     Q    All right.  What did you say at that
3906=point?
3907=     A    I said that my conclusion that the state
3908=enacted a plan with 30 splits, which was the maximum
3909=in the guidelines that the house itself gave via the
3910=Redistricting Commission was not a good-faith
3911=effort, because with relatively little work, I was
3912=able to create plans which had as few as 22 splits,
3913=which I say then is significantly different than
3914=those 30 splits.
3915=     Q    All right.  I would like to direct you
3916=back to these two tabs that are document printouts
3917=from Dave's Redistricting.  We can look at Tab 13
3918=first.  That's the 13d_e that you just looked at.
fmt=pb
3919=     A    Yes, I'm here.
3920=     Q    And is this a map that says "TN house
3921=13d_e" on the top?
3922=     A    It is.
3923=     Q    Take as much time as you need to look.  Is
3924=there any indication on here as when this screenshot
3925=was taken?
3926=     A    No.  There's no data on here that I can
3927=see.
3928=     Q    Okay.  And is there a copyright date on
3929=this document, perhaps in the bottom, left?
3930=     A    Yeah, it says "Copyright 2023 Dave's
3931=Redistricting, LLC."
3932=     Q    So, there's no screenshot or print date on
3933=here that you see, but there is a 2023 copyright
3934=date?
3935=     A    Yes.
3936=     Q    And then, the other Tab was Tab 30.  Have
3937=you made it to Tab 30?
3938=     A    Yes, I'm here.
3939=     Q    And is that a map that states "TN 2022
3940=state house"?
3941=     A    It is.
3942=     Q    And the same question, do you see any date
3943=on here reflecting the screenshot or the print date?
fmt=pb
3944=     A    There's no date for this map on this
3945=screenshot.  There is the 2023 Dave's Redistricting
3946=LLC copyright at the bottom, left.
3947=     Q    Okay.  Now, Dr. Cervas, earlier you
3948=testified that you believed it is possible for
3949=someone without knowledge of the Law to draw a
3950=compliant map, correct?
3951=     A    That's correct.
3952=     Q    Can you explain what you meant by that?
3953=     A    Well, I could mean several things
3954=actually.  For one, there are around the country
3955=many Independent Redistricting Commissions that
3956=include citizens that draw maps that become Law and
3957=are included in the elections, presumably
3958=Constitutionally according to all the Law;
3959=otherwise, they would not be put into place.  So,
3960=certainly somebody without the knowledge of the Law
3961=can draw those plans.
3962=               Additionally, maps can be drawn blind
3963=to the Law.  Any of us could go and draw a map that
3964=could be consistent with the Law without having to
3965=have understood what the Law is.  This is not an
3966=exercise of legality.  This is an exercise of using
3967=a computer mouse to draw districts.  I just simply
3968=believe that it is possible for somebody to draw a
fmt=pb
3969=map without knowing the Law.
3970=     Q    But are you someone who doesn't have any
3971=knowledge of the Law in redistricting?
3972=     A    I believe I understand the Law on
3973=redistricting as well as probably anybody else in
3974=this country.
3975=     Q    Document 85 is your temporary injunction
3976=report.  Can you look to that?
3977=     A    Yes.
3978=     Q    Counsel asked you a good number of
3979=questions about your use of a computer as the map
3980=drawer here, correct?
3981=     A    Yes.
3982=     Q    Did you in any way hide the fact that a
3983=computer did the map drawing in this report?
3984=     A    Absolutely not.  I talk about the
3985=algorithm chain and describe what it is in this
3986=report.
3987=     Q    Can I direct you to Page 11 of this
3988=report.  Does 11 reflect in detail some of the
3989=computerized process that was used in this report?
3990=     A    It does.
3991=     Q    Earlier you testified to your belief that
3992=the state did not do a Voting Rights Act analysis of
3993=the enacted house map?
fmt=pb
3994=     A    Yeah, I was not provided one.  I do not
3995=know.  It wasn't made public.
3996=     Q    Did you review the transcript of Doug
3997=Himes fact witness deposition when counsel sent it
3998=to you?
3999=     A    I did, yes.
4000=     Q    Do you recall whether or not Doug Himes
4001=testified that he performed a Voting Rights Act
4002=analysis?
4003=     A    I do not.
4004=     Q    Would it help you to look at his
4005=deposition?
4006=     A    That would be helpful.
4007=     Q    His deposition is under Tab 4.  And once
4008=you are at Doug Himes' fact witness deposition at
4009=Tab 4, I direct you to Page 79 of his transcripts.
4010=Then, take your time to do this, but starting at
4011=line 16, if you could read to yourself that page and
4012=the next page and a half that talk about whether or
4013=not Mr. Himes performed a Voting Rights Act
4014=analysis.
4015=          MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, we would object
4016=     because it's hearsay.  It's not Mr. Himes
4017=     testifying here.  It's an out of court
4018=     statement for the truth of the matter asserted.
fmt=pb
4019=          MR. TIFT:  Your Honors, we are not
4020=     offering this as the truth of the matter
4021=     asserted.  Under Rule 612, a witness may be
4022=     provided a writing to refresh their memory.
4023=     Mr. Swatley asked Dr. Cervas on what bases he
4024=     believes that the state had not performed a
4025=     Voting Rights Act analysis.
4026=          He has testified that he did review Mr.
4027=     Himes' testimony on this point and that it
4028=     would refresh his recollection to look back at
4029=     it.  So that would inform his knowledge to
4030=     Mr. Swatley's question.  That's the intent of
4031=     him looking at this to refresh his
4032=     recollection.  And if so, testifying if that
4033=     informed his knowledge of whether or not the
4034=     state performed a Voting Rights Act analysis.
4035=          CHIEF JUDGE:  The Court will allow you to
4036=     go a little bit further with this.
4037=     Q    (By Mr. Tift) All right.  Dr. Cervas, it
4038=starts on Page 77 at line 16.  So I'm not asking you
4039=to read this aloud, but to yourself to see if it
4040=refreshes your recollection.  Start at line 16 and
4041=read to the next two pages, and let us know once you
4042=have completed your reading.
4043=     A    (Witness complies.)
fmt=pb
4044=     Q    Have you reviewed the section?
4045=     A    I have.
4046=     Q    And has reviewing this portion of
4047=Mr. Himes' deposition refreshed your recollection
4048=about whether your belief that the state did not
4049=perform a Voting Rights Act analysis, did his
4050=deposition inform your belief in that fact?
4051=     A    Yes.
4052=     Q    And we're done with that.  You can put
4053=that one away.
4054=               A few times earlier with questioning
4055=from opposing counsel, you referred to Mr. Himes'
4056=testimony this morning.  I'm wondering if that was a
4057=slip of the names, and you were meaning to refer to
4058=Mr. Trende's testimony this morning?
4059=     A    Yes, my apologies.  If I referred to
4060=Mr. Himes this morning, it would have been actually
4061=Mr. Trende.
4062=     Q    You were asked some questions by opposing
4063=counsel about whether or not it's always a tradeoff
4064=of lower deviations for more splits.  Do you
4065=remember that question?
4066=     A    I actually don't remember that phrase in
4067=the question.
4068=     Q    Well, let me ask you, your map 13d_e has a
fmt=pb
4069=lower total variance than the enacted house map,
4070=correct?
4071=     A    Yes, 9.89.
4072=     Q    And does it also have six fewer county
4073=splits?
4074=     A    It does.
4075=     Q    And finally, you have heard throughout the
4076=trial and opening an articulation that Defendants
4077=are expected to demonstrate that as few counties
4078=were crossed as necessary to comply with federal
4079=requirements, correct?
4080=     A    I have heard that.
4081=     Q    And you have watched the whole trial so
4082=far?
4083=     A    Yes.
4084=     Q    As an expert witness on redistricting,
4085=have you heard or seen anything in trial that
4086=demonstrates to you that the enacted house map
4087=crossed as few county lines as necessary to comply
4088=with federal constitutional requirements?
4089=     A    I think it's unequivocal that the
4090=legislature did not enact the plan that crosses as
4091=few lines as possible to comply with the Federal
4092=Constitution.
4093=     Q    And has anything during trial changed your
fmt=pb
4094=opinion about that thus far?
4095=     A    That is still my opinion.
4096=     Q    And so, you just testified to your
4097=opinion.  Are you suggesting to the Court that any
4098=specific map in your report is the map that the
4099=legislature should pass?
4100=     A    Unequivocally, no.  I do not believe that
4101=these maps are necessarily suitable for the
4102=legislature.  If the legislature believes that they
4103=are good maps, they are welcome to adopt one of
4104=these maps, so long as they do the proper voting
4105=rights in that, ensure that they haven't diluted
4106=people's votes.  But again, those choices were all
4107=made by the legislature already.
4108=               But I would not personally consider
4109=any of these maps to be best or ideal or one that I
4110=would submit to a Court.  I would want to work from
4111=a more blank slate and make sure that every citizen
4112=in Tennessee is treated equally under these plans.
4113=     Q    And so remind us, what is the utility of
4114=your illustrative maps to your opinion in this case?
4115=     A    The question that was posed to me by
4116=Plaintiffs' counsel upon me agreeing to be their
4117=expert was, is it possible to draw a plan for the
4118=state house in Tennessee that divides fewer counties
fmt=pb
4119=than the enacted plan while being consistent with
4120=federal law?  And I have answered that question
4121=through any demonstrative maps, and that's the
4122=purpose of those demonstrative maps.
4123=          MR. TIFT:  I have no more questions.
4124=                       - - -
4125=
4126=RECROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. SWATLEY:
4127=     Q    Dr. Cervas, do you still have your
4128=deposition in front of you?
4129=     A    Yes.
4130=     Q    Tab 3, Page 130.  In your deposition, you
4131=were asked the question:
4132=          "So, along with compliance with state and
4133=     federal requirements for redistricting, is it
4134=     your belief that it is a Tennessee
4135=     constitutional requirement that as few counties
4136=     can be split that's the most you can split?"
4137=          And what was your answer to that on line
4138=     6?
4139=     A    Well, there's two parts.  The whole thing?
4140=Because it was objected to.
4141=          MR. TIFT:  I'll make a quick objection.
4142=     I'll allow it on this question, but expert
4143=     deposition testimony is only allowed to be used
fmt=pb
4144=     for impeachment.  So it should only be
4145=     following a countervailing answer to a question
4146=     that you first asked him under the Rules, Use
4147=     of Depositions in trial, Tennessee Rule Civil
4148=     Procedure 32.
4149=          So, he can certainly answer you.  But we
4150=     would ask that in the future this only be used
4151=     for impeachment after a prior question.
4152=          CHIEF JUDGE:  You can answer this
4153=     question.
4154=          THE WITNESS:  Okay.  And so line 6, I say,
4155=     "Yeah."  And then, it was objected to.  And it
4156=     continues on line 9, "Let me see.  Page 7 of
4157=     this report, I have a line quoting from state
4158=     ex Rel. Lockert v. Crowell:  Cross as few
4159=     county lines as is necessary to comply with the
4160=     Federal Constitution."
4161=     Q    (By Mr. Swatley) And when you quote
4162=Lockert v. Cromwell there, was that I, II, or III?
4163=     A    I don't have the full citation here.
4164=     Q    And earlier you testified you never read
4165=Lockert II in its entirety before drawing these
4166=maps?
4167=     A    That's right.
4168=     Q    You never read Lockert III?
fmt=pb
4169=     A    In its entirety, no.
4170=     Q    And you never read Rural West Tennessee
4171=cases?
4172=     A    In its entirety, no.
4173=     Q    You never read Lincoln v. Crowell?
4174=     A    In its entirety, no.
4175=     Q    Have you read Moore v. State?
4176=     A    I'm not sure.
4177=     Q    Are you confused because you think Moore
4178=v. State is this case?
4179=     A    No.  I'm not sure which case you are
4180=talking about.  I'm sorry.
4181=          MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, I'll confer with
4182=     counsel real quick.
4183=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Of course.
4184=          MR. SWATLEY:  I'm done.
4185=          MR. TIFT:  No Redirect.
4186=          CHIEF JUDGE:  You can step down, sir.
4187=          THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
4188=          MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, Plaintiffs rest at
4189=     this point.
4190=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
4191=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, at this point,
4192=     Defendants move for a Directed Verdict as to
4193=     the senate claim under Tennessee Rules of Civil
fmt=pb
4194=     Procedure 50.01.
4195=          MR. TIFT:  Are you going to argue it?
4196=          MR. RIEGER:  Certainly.
4197=          If the Court would like me to argue it, I
4198=     will.
4199=          MR. TIFT:  We certainly object.
4200=     [Inaudible].
4201=          CHIEF JUDGE:  I'm not sure Rule 50 is the
4202=     right rule.  We might be talking about Rule 41,
4203=     Involuntary Dismissal.  But go ahead.
4204=          MR. RIEGER:  Yes, Your Honor.  I
4205=     apologize.  The Panel is certainly not a jury.
4206=          So, Defendants are moving for directed
4207=     verdict as to senate claims, because Plaintiffs
4208=     have not met their burden to demonstrate
4209=     standing.  And we know that because of the
4210=     examination of Ms. Hunt, including what she was
4211=     asked by her own counsel and what she was asked
4212=     on Cross Examination.
4213=          So during the Cross Examination, Ms. Hunt
4214=     was asked whether or not she was denied in the
4215=     2022 election the benefit of staggered terms.
4216=     Her answer was no.  So under the new map, she
4217=     has not suffered an injury.  That's not
4218=     necessarily fatal for standing, because she can
fmt=pb
4219=     show that an injury is imminent.  She testified
4220=     that she lived in Davidson County from 1999 to
4221=     the present.  Davidson County was
4222=     non-consecutively numbered from 1990 to 2010
4223=     and again from 2020 to the present.
4224=          Plaintiff's own counsel asked her if she
4225=     knew of an incumbent losing a primary.  The
4226=     answer was no.  Then, Plaintiff's counsel asked
4227=     her if she knew of any incumbents losing their
4228=     general election.  Her answer to that question
4229=     was no.  And what happened in 2002 according to
4230=     her testimony, two of the three incumbents won,
4231=     and the other, which was Brenda Gilmore,
4232=     retired.  That is the opposite of imminent.
4233=     That's unlikely.
4234=          Ms. Hunt's own testimony elicited from
4235=     both Cross Examination and Direct Examination
4236=     confirms that there was no actual denial of the
4237=     benefits of staggered terms by the new senate
4238=     map.  And the possibility that it could occur
4239=     is not imminent.  It is remote.  That doesn't
4240=     get you standing under the applicable Tennessee
4241=     precedence of City of Memphis and ACLU v.
4242=     Darnell.
4243=          Plaintiffs proof by their own witness's
fmt=pb
4244=     testimony fails to meet the standard.  And
4245=     their proof is now closed; therefore, we move
4246=     for involuntary dismissal pursuant to Tennessee
4247=     Rules of Civil Procedure 41.  Thank you.
4248=          MR. GARRISON:  Your Honors, I'll be brief.
4249=     The state is arguing this case to depart from
4250=     well-settled Law on standing and asking this
4251=     Court to adopt a dangerous principle.  The
4252=     citizens in this state don't have standing to
4253=     bring constitutional claims until they have
4254=     somehow faced election consequences and have
4255=     some sort of political retribution based upon
4256=     them by the State's unconstitutional actions.
4257=          The theme of this case, which Your Honors
4258=     have heard for over a year.  I'm talking the
4259=     senate claim hearing, which Your Honors issued
4260=     a temporary injunction on, which the Tennessee
4261=     Supreme Court did not touch with respect to
4262=     your findings of the likelihood of success, but
4263=     rather said this shouldn't be applied to the
4264=     2022 election.
4265=          This case is as simple as it sounds.  The
4266=     state of Tennessee has drawn senate districts
4267=     that are not consecutive in number in Davidson
4268=     County, the only county in the state where this
fmt=pb
4269=     has happened, even though the state
4270=     Constitution requires it.
4271=          Now, Plaintiffs put on proof in this trial
4272=     in every possible way we thought Your Honors
4273=     may be interested in hearing about Ms. Hunt:
4274=     Her background, her voting history, her
4275=     advocacy, why she cares about her rights as a
4276=     citizen, why she has exercised her rights as a
4277=     citizen.  But we didn't need to.  All we needed
4278=     to do is show that Ms. Hunt is a voter in
4279=     Davidson County and in the district that's
4280=     improperly numbered.
4281=          That should be enough in any state but
4282=     certainly the state of Tennessee, because all
4283=     citizens have rights that are defined by the
4284=     Tennessee Constitution, and the Tennessee
4285=     Constitution says that senate districts should
4286=     be consecutively numbered in a county.  These
4287=     are not.  Ms. Hunt is a voter and a citizen in
4288=     that very misnumbered district.  If she doesn't
4289=     have standing to bring this case, then imagine
4290=     how that principle can be applied to all other
4291=     provisions of the Tennessee Constitution.
4292=          She doesn't have to recite her voting
4293=     history dating back to the '90s or recall how
fmt=pb
4294=     elections shook out; although, I would point
4295=     out to you, I can name how there's been
4296=     turnover in Ms. Hunt's voting lifetime in
4297=     Tennessee in every senate district in this
4298=     county.  We could go back in the history of
4299=     that.  So the public record shows there's been
4300=     turnover.
4301=          But to require that there be somehow some
4302=     sort of circumstance where voters in the state
4303=     have said, you know, because of the state not
4304=     following the Constitution, my representation
4305=     did not seem right because of the turnover of
4306=     my representation at the General Assembly.
4307=     That's a requirement that is made up.  It's not
4308=     based on case Law, and citizens in this state
4309=     should be allowed to enforce the provisions of
4310=     the Constitution as they have for years.
4311=          And so this motion should be denied.
4312=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
4313=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, to start, injury
4314=     in fact that requirement for standing is not
4315=     novel.  It has existed in federal and Tennessee
4316=     jurisprudence for decades.  It's Tennesseans
4317=     for Sensible Election Laws III.  It's City of
4318=     Memphis v. Hargett.  It's ACLU v. Darnell.  In
fmt=pb
4319=     the federal world, it's Valley Forge.  It's not
4320=     novel.  It is the standard.  And, yes, she may
4321=     very well have an injury in Law, but standing
4322=     does not ask that question.  Standing says,
4323=     what is your injury in fact.
4324=          She has testified that she was not denied
4325=     the benefit of staggered terms in 2022.  That
4326=     was her harm.  That's what she complained she
4327=     was deprived of.  She says in the 2022 election
4328=     she was not deprived of that harm.  She has an
4329=     out.  She can show that that harm is imminent,
4330=     but that's where it comes into play as to the
4331=     historical data.
4332=          To show that, she would have to show that
4333=     there is some reasonable possibility that all
4334=     three seats in Davidson County could turn over
4335=     at once.  And she says very plainly, she does
4336=     not know of any incumbents ever losing a
4337=     primary.  She does not know of any incumbents
4338=     ever losing a general.  So she can't show
4339=     imminence and that's her burden.  Now,
4340=     Plaintiffs have come up here and said, well, we
4341=     have got what is a violation of the Tennessee
4342=     Constitution, that Davidson County is
4343=     non-consecutively numbered.
fmt=pb
4344=          Unfortunately for Plaintiffs, standing
4345=     defeats potentially meritorious constitutional
4346=     challenges all the time.  That was the case in
4347=     Tennessee for Sensible Election Laws III.
4348=     Tennessee has all sorts of Laws on the books
4349=     that if they were applied to someone, may very
4350=     well be constitutional, but we don't just allow
4351=     someone to show up and say, that's
4352=     unconstitutional.  They have to show that
4353=     somehow it harms and affects them.
4354=          And Ms. Hunt has disclaimed both of those
4355=     in her examination testimony.  And for that
4356=     reason and since Plaintiffs' proof is closed,
4357=     the Defense is entitled to judgment.  Thank
4358=     you.
4359=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.  The Court
4360=     respectfully denies the motion consistent with
4361=     the Court's ruling in the summary judgment
4362=     motion, that it was reserving ruling on this.
4363=     And we have a pretrial order that contemplates
4364=     posttrial briefs.
4365=          As you can see, we have got three judges
4366=     up here, and the judges decided we wanted all
4367=     the briefing, all the proof that have we could
4368=     have before we decided this issue.  Given this
fmt=pb
4369=     unusual situation, where going forward with a
4370=     trial would not necessarily prejudice the
4371=     Defendants, given that a defense on the
4372=     constitutional grounds, on the merits has not
4373=     been offered.  So we haven't asserted in an
4374=     affirmative sense jurisdiction over this.
4375=          But the Panel wants to see every briefing
4376=     that can possibly be made on this issue before
4377=     we make a definitive issue.  So, the
4378=     well-argued standing arguments made by the
4379=     Defendants are not falling out of the case
4380=     because the Court wants the opportunity to get
4381=     additional briefing and also full opportunity
4382=     to confer among the judges.
4383=          So, we are denying your motion.  The issue
4384=     is not falling out of the case.  The Court in
4385=     the summary judgment motion indicated that it
4386=     wanted to reserve ruling.  In this particular
4387=     situation, the Panel concluded that Defendants
4388=     would not be prejudice if we did not rule on
4389=     this subject-matter jurisdiction.  As you know,
4390=     subject-matter jurisdiction can be ruled upon
4391=     at anytime.  It can be ruled upon on appeal.
4392=          So given this situation, that's where we
4393=     stand.  And certainly if this Panel was going
fmt=pb
4394=     to rule today on standing, we would have to
4395=     take time from the trial, go out and confer,
4396=     and we're not going to do that.  Rather, we're
4397=     just going to deny the motion with the
4398=     expressed statement that standing is not
4399=     falling out of the case.  It is a viable claim
4400=     that will considered in the Court's final
4401=     ruling.
4402=          MR. RIEGER:  Thank you, Your Honor.
4403=          Your Honor, at this time the Defense calls
4404=     Mr. Himes.
4405=          And, Your Honors, with your permission,
4406=     when Mr. Himes was here yesterday, he had some
4407=     issues reading the copy of the map that was in
4408=     the record already.  He's provided these
4409=     additional demonstratives.  Plaintiffs have
4410=     agreed to their use and if I may, I would like
4411=     to pass them out, so that way they can be
4412=     available to review.
4413=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Sure.
4414=                       - - -
4415=
4416=DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. RIEGER:
4417=     Q    Welcome back, Mr. Himes.  My name is Alex
4418=Rieger, and I'll be asking you a few questions
fmt=pb
4419=today.  If you could, go ahead and reintroduce
4420=yourself to the Court.
4421=     A    Sure.  Your Honors, good afternoon.  My
4422=name is Doug Himes.  I'm the Ethics Counsel for the
4423=Tennessee House of Representatives.
4424=          CHIEF JUDGE:  And you're still under oath.
4425=          THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.
4426=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) Mr. Himes, if I could
4427=start by directing you to Exhibit 15 please, which I
4428=believe had been previously admitted.  Are you
4429=there?
4430=     A    I am, yes.
4431=     Q    Excellent.  If I could get you to flip to
4432=the back, please, until you reach the page that
4433=starts "Douglas David Himes."
4434=     A    I'm there.
4435=     Q    Is this your CV?
4436=     A    This is.
4437=     Q    When was this CV created?
4438=     A    It was created in -- it was updated, I
4439=would say, in, gosh, I'm trying to find the date of
4440=the report.  I would be -- I don't know if there is
4441=a date on the report.  But it would have been
4442=updated before the report was filed.
4443=     Q    Is there in anything on the CV you need to
fmt=pb
4444=add?
4445=     A    No, I do not believe so.
4446=     Q    Would you walk us through your CV starting
4447=with your education, please.
4448=     A    Under "Education" which is Page 48, I went
4449=to Lambuth University in Jackson, Tennessee for
4450=undergraduate studies.  I majored in history and
4451=theater as a minor.  I was fortunate enough to get a
4452=rotary ambassadorial scholarship to attend the
4453=University of Saint Andrews for graduate studies.  I
4454=had a problem.  They thought I knew Latin when they
4455=admitted me.  I do not know Latin.  I did not get a
4456=Masters but received a diploma in arts and medieval
4457=history.  I studied society in England from roughly
4458=1000 to about 1111, I guess it was, basically the
4459=Norman Conquest period of time.  And then, I
4460=attended law school at the University of Notre Dame,
4461=graduated there in 1997.
4462=     Q    Thank you.  And if you could just briefly
4463=walk us through your job history again.
4464=     A    Certainly.  I graduated from Notre Dame
4465=on, I guess it was, a Saturday, maybe a Sunday.  I
4466=can't remember.  It's a long time ago.  And started
4467=at the Attorney General's office on a Monday after
4468=graduation starting as a clerk in the Attorney
fmt=pb
4469=General's Office, and worked in the criminal justice
4470=division for about a year and a half.
4471=               After that, I had the opportunity to
4472=return to legal services.  I mentioned to y'all
4473=yesterday that I had worked in legal services as a
4474=session researcher for one session in the early mid
4475='90s drafting resolutions.  They had an opportunity
4476=for a lawyer, a full-time position.  And I left the
4477=Attorney General's Office to go back and work at the
4478=General Assembly.  Of course, I worked in criminal
4479=justice division, but when I got back to the General
4480=Assembly, I was assigned to work on transportation
4481=committees.
4482=               And over the years, I worked on
4483=transportation committees in both houses and various
4484=other committees until spending most of the time as
4485=the house finance attorney for a little bit over a
4486=decade.  During that time, I also served beginning
4487=in 2003, I served as the attorney for the house
4488=ethics committee, which is what I do now, except as
4489=an employee of just the house.  But during my time
4490=in legal services, I was in that role.
4491=               I also, legal services provides
4492=counsel to the speakers, and I served as counsel to
4493=Speaker Jimmy Naifeh, Speaker Kent Williams, and
fmt=pb
4494=Speaker Beth Harwell.  Also during that time, I was
4495=assigned to be the lead attorney for the 2010 rounds
4496=of redistricting for the House of Representatives.
4497=               And I would just say that then in
4498=June or July of 2018, I left legal services and went
4499=to work with the Bureau of Ethics and Campaign
4500=Finance under Drew Rawlins, served as his assistant
4501=director.  And then, I had the opportunity to come
4502=back to the General Assembly in June of 2019.  The
4503=house created this position for me to be the house
4504=ethics counsel to help members with compliance with
4505=statutes and legislative rules.
4506=     Q    What if any experience do you have with
4507=redistricting?
4508=     A    So when I was a Legislative intern, which
4509=is here somewhere in this resume in 1992, Steve
4510=Cohen, who I was assigned to then state and local
4511=government committee.  Then state Senator Steve
4512=Cohen, now Congressman Steve Cohen, asked me to work
4513=with legal services on senate districts in Shelby
4514=County.  That was the first time I had any chance to
4515=work in redistricting, and that was the first
4516=redistricting that legal services went from having
4517=big paper maps with crayons to a big Sun system
4518=computer.  And I had the opportunity at that time to
fmt=pb
4519=kind of get my feet wet and work on the senate
4520=districts in Shelby County.  And I found it was
4521=fascinating.  And that was the first opportunity.
4522=               When I went back to legal services in
4523='98, the house was still in litigation in the Rural
4524=West Tennessee cases, and the then assistant
4525=director of legal services at that time, Ellen
4526=Tewes, asked if I would help her as that case was
4527=proceeding to the Sixth Circuit and then on to the
4528=Supreme Court.  And I used our old system to produce
4529=the maps of Plan A and Plan B.  I didn't have a
4530=whole lot else to do on the Rural West case on the
4531=house side.
4532=               Assistant Director Tewes quickly
4533=became Director Tewes of the office of legal
4534=services.  She encouraged my participation with
4535=NCSL, which is the National Conference of state
4536=legislatures.  They have a particular staff section,
4537=kind of a focus area on redistricting and elections.
4538=It has had various names over the years.  And I
4539=started participating with that section in 1999, I
4540=think was the first NCSL I went to.  I got to know
4541=more about the census, work with the Census Bureau.
4542=And then, Speaker Naifeh appointed me under her
4543=advice to be the lead counsel for that 2000 round of
fmt=pb
4544=redistricting.
4545=               After that, by the 2010 census,
4546=Director Tewes had retired.  Joe Barnes was then
4547=director of legal services.  Speaker Harwell was the
4548=speaker.  And I was asked to be the lead attorney
4549=from legal services again to work on the house
4550=redistricting in the 2012 round.  And then when we
4551=advanced to 2020, I come back in the role of house
4552=ethics counsel.  And Speaker Sexton, when he
4553=appointed the ad hoc committee, he appointed me to
4554=serve as the counsel to that committee.
4555=               In between that, my involvement with
4556=the NCSL's redistricting task force continued.  I
4557=served as a staff co-chair for a period of time.
4558=I'm still active in that and helped Tennessee when
4559=Tennessee years ago edited part of the red book that
4560=you have heard about.  We did some of the equal
4561=population part of that.  And I helped with that.
4562=And I think I added the case note in the red book
4563=the last round for the Moore decision.  So that's
4564=sort of the history.
4565=     Q    Is it fair to say you have been involved
4566=with redistricting process in Tennessee for 30
4567=years?
4568=     A    Yes, that's fair.
fmt=pb
4569=     Q    Is that on a partisan or nonpartisan
4570=basis?
4571=     A    Nonpartisan.
4572=     Q    Can you explain that a little more?
4573=     A    Sure.  So in my current role and in all
4574=the roles I have had in state Government have always
4575=been nonpartisan roles.  Legal services nonpartisan
4576=counsel to the house and senate.  Legal services
4577=works for 132 members and takes the nonpartisan side
4578=of it very seriously.  So when I was in that office,
4579=I was the nonpartisan counsel to the redistricting
4580=committee.
4581=               Fast forward to this current
4582=position, I'm nonpartisan ethics counsel.  I work
4583=for 99 house members and I take that very seriously.
4584=I have served at the pleasure of Democratic speakers
4585=and Republican speakers.  And it's something that I
4586=think is important to this process, that the house
4587=utilizes nonpartisan staff to help in the process.
4588=               Part of that is, is we don't keep any
4589=partisan data in our database for redistricting.
4590=Maptitude could have it.  I think it could be
4591=imported, but that's something that we have never
4592=done as a nonpartisan employee.  That's not
4593=something I would utilize.  So I feel it's an
fmt=pb
4594=important process that makes how the Tennessee house
4595=process, makes it unique.
4596=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, at this time,
4597=     Defendants move to have Mr. Himes qualified as
4598=     an expert witness in Tennessee Redistricting
4599=     Law procedures and practices by virtue of his
4600=     three decades of experience and that he may
4601=     testify and form an opinion.
4602=          MR. TIFT:  No objection.
4603=          CHIEF JUDGE:  No objection and so the
4604=     Court determines that Mr. Himes can be an
4605=     expert witness and testify in the categories
4606=     that you mentioned.
4607=          MR. RIEGER:  Thank you, Your Honor.
4608=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) So I want to talk about
4609=the redistricting process generally, so not specific
4610=to this map that we are all here on today.  Can you
4611=walk us through the relevant authority that might
4612=set out requirements for redistricting maps?
4613=     A    Okay.  I think I can follow that.  You are
4614=not talking about the process of when we get the
4615=census data.  This is more of what we would look at
4616=after we have that data.
4617=     Q    What are the rules?
4618=     A    What are the rules, good way to say it.
fmt=pb
4619=The number one rule population equality, one person,
4620=one vote.  That's what we are drawing a map to
4621=comply with, and that is the number one rule, to fit
4622=that.  Now, how you get there, what's the
4623=justification in a state redistricting plan to have
4624=any kind of deviation, why isn't it zero?  There's
4625=got to be a legitimate state interest.  And that's
4626=where factors like county splitting and core
4627=preservation play a big part of, because those are
4628=both legitimate state interests to have that
4629=deviation.
4630=               But beyond population equality, then
4631=underneath of that, the Voting Rights Act.  That is
4632=in my opinion, having done this for 30 years and
4633=having the experience on the outside of Rural West
4634=Tennessee cases, I think that's of utmost
4635=importance, compliance with the Voting Rights Act.
4636=Obviously, race cannot predominate a redistricting
4637=plan, and it's important that it doesn't.  But
4638=compliance with the Voting Rights Act is almost
4639=right there with the population equality.
4640=               And then, you know, there's the
4641=factors that are listed in 3-1-103, and there's the
4642=six other factors that we have listed.  Contiguity
4643=is also a state constitutional requirement.  That's
fmt=pb
4644=one of the other four.  We want to make sure that we
4645=use the census data.  We want to use the most recent
4646=census data, both the population and the geography.
4647=               Several years ago there was the idea
4648=that they would adjust data and they didn't.  They
4649=used the actual count.  But somebody might produce
4650=data that is adjusted, and we're not going to use
4651=that.  We're going to use whatever the census data
4652=produces.
4653=               I think I've got four of the six.
4654=I'm going to try to think of the others off the top
4655=of my head.  We're not going to do multimember
4656=districts.  At one time, Tennessee did have some
4657=multimember districts.  Some states still have a
4658=form of multimember districts.
4659=               And then, the last one, it's there
4660=somewhere, and it's in here somewhere.
4661=     Q    We'll see if we can get to it as we go
4662=through.  Are any of the requirements you listed --
4663=          MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, just for the record
4664=     wanted to state basically the same standing
4665=     objection that certainly Mr. Himes can continue
4666=     testifying as our expert did his understanding
4667=     of the Law.  But of course, we all recognize
4668=     the Court will determine the actual Law in the
fmt=pb
4669=     case.
4670=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.  So noted.
4671=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) So Mr. Himes, out of the
4672=requirements you just listed, how do you determine
4673=which is more important?
4674=     A    The Federal constitutional provisions are
4675=the Law of the Land.  So we'll comply with the
4676=Federal Constitution provisions, then the federal
4677=law provisions, and then we will work with the state
4678=constitutional provisions, and then the practices,
4679=the criteria that the house has set, not only in TCA
4680=3-1-103 but also in the two practices that we have
4681=used over the 30 years.
4682=     Q    To your knowledge, are there any
4683=constitutional provisions that limit what factors
4684=the General Assembly can use in redistricting?
4685=     A    I would say to the contrary, there's a
4686=constitutional provision that anticipates that the
4687=General Assembly will set the criteria for
4688=redistricting, and that's Article 2, Section 4 of
4689=the Constitution.  I think it's the second or third
4690=sentence.  It says, Nothing in this section, nor
4691=this Article 2 -- essentially, I'm paraphrasing --
4692=shall deprive the General Assembly from
4693=redistricting at anytime based on geography
fmt=pb
4694=population or other criteria.
4695=               And I think that allows the General
4696=Assembly to take those six factors that are
4697=articulated in 3-1-103 in the two practices, which
4698=is core retention and minimizing incumbent pairing.
4699=Those eight are the criteria that I think envisioned
4700=Article 2, Section 4.
4701=     Q    So again, I'm not asking about the
4702=specific map at issue here.  So generally, how does
4703=the redistricting process begin in Tennessee?
4704=     A    So, the redistricting process in a
4705=non-COVID year -- this was a different census and a
4706=different redistricting process because of COVID.
4707=               But the process starts before the
4708=Census Bureau produces the results.  Our state
4709=comptroller works with the bureau to make sure that
4710=localities have all the boundaries and census blocks
4711=they need.  They work with them throughout the
4712=decade leading up to the census.  It's a program on
4713=the called the Block Boundary Suggestion Survey that
4714=they work with the comptroller's office.  They work
4715=in hand with the Census Bureau.  They work on things
4716=like, we have recently changed a few county
4717=boundaries, the legislature has, and the
4718=Comptroller's Office will work to make sure those
fmt=pb
4719=are incorporated into the next round of geography.
4720=               From a planning level, the General
4721=Assembly, we are going to make sure that we have the
4722=technology that we need, that when we get the census
4723=data, that we will be able to use technology for
4724=people who aren't GIS experts, which is Geographic
4725=Information Systems.  Something that somebody that's
4726=a lawyer can use to draw maps and to explain and
4727=produce maps for the members that they can
4728=understand easily.
4729=               So we'll look at our technological
4730=needs.  We'll look at our staffing needs.  I was
4731=hoping this time we could have some folks that
4732=worked in GIS.  We didn't hire anyone that had any
4733=experience until very late in the redistricting
4734=cycle.  And hopefully, those employees who didn't
4735=have a whole lot of experience this time will have
4736=experience going forward.  It's hopefully building
4737=some institutional knowledge going forward.
4738=               You want to make sure you have
4739=staffing.  So I had some attorneys in legal services
4740=that I worked with before COVID to just talk about
4741=the red book and some of the concepts of
4742=redistricting in the hopes that, again, there can be
4743=some continuity going forward.  Weren't utilized
fmt=pb
4744=this round but hopefully they will have a little
4745=understanding of what redistricting is.  So we do
4746=all that preparation work and we get that ready.
4747=               And then, in a normal decade, census
4748=date is April 1st of the year ending in zero, so
4749=April 1st, 2020.  And of course, COVID is happening
4750=right about the same time this time.  In a normal
4751=decade, the federal law requires that those results
4752=should be reported by January 1st of the year ending
4753=in one, so January 1, 2021.  And what's reported is
4754=the apportionment data, which is the resident
4755=population of the United States and the states.
4756=               And with that you can determine, you
4757=know, what your ideal populations.  We looked at
4758=that yesterday.  What's Tennessee's total?  And
4759=divide it by 9, 33, and 99 and come up with the
4760=ideals for the US house and senate and state house.
4761=So that data usually is there by January 1 of 2021.
4762=This time we didn't receive that data until, I think
4763=it was, in April of 2021.  So there was a
4764=significant delay in getting that data out there.
4765=               And knowing that we were going to
4766=have the delays for the last couple rounds, we have
4767=established a website on the house side to try to
4768=give people updates.  In a normal year, that website
fmt=pb
4769=isn't established until we get the state level
4770=redistricting data.  But knowing there were going to
4771=be delays because of COVID, we started that website
4772=in January of 2021.  And had me on there as a point
4773=of contact for people that had questions about what
4774=was going on.  And I tried to keep that updated.
4775=               So when we got that apportionment
4776=data in April, I did a letter to the Speaker and
4777=laid out what the Tennessee population was and what
4778=the ideal numbers would be, and we put that up on
4779=the website as soon as we could.  So in a normal
4780=non-COVID year what we are waiting for is the state
4781=level redistricting data.  That's the micro data
4782=that goes down to the census block level of
4783=geography that includes all the different
4784=demographic characteristics of the population.
4785=               Now, there's some adjustment to that
4786=for privacy reasons, but that's the data we
4787=typically get in a non-COVID year in February or
4788=March, but it's been February when we get it.
4789=Unfortunately, because of COVID that was delayed
4790=until the middle of August essentially in 2021,
4791=which shortened the period of time that we had to
4792=work with data by about half.  So that data comes to
4793=us in August and in a normal year and in this year,
fmt=pb
4794=once we have that data, the Speaker has
4795=traditionally appointed a committee to take up
4796=redistricting.
4797=               This was the first time that the
4798=committee included members of both parties.  It was
4799=not balanced.  It was unbalanced.  I think there
4800=were 16 members:  12 Republicans and 4 Democrats if
4801=I remember correctly.  That committee met in
4802=September.  It met in October.  Both those meetings
4803=taking public comments.  And then met again in
4804=December to review the plans.
4805=               Importantly at the September meeting,
4806=the committee looked at criteria and guidelines and
4807=they adopted criteria and guidelines, and we talked
4808=a little bit about that yesterday.  But it was also
4809=giving the public the opportunity to draw a map and
4810=present that and see if they could help us with this
4811=puzzle that is redistricting.  And they had from
4812=September 8th to November 12th to submit plans.  We
4813=only had four plans submitted.
4814=               Leading up and through this process,
4815=I tried to encourage this every time I could for
4816=people to submit a plan, offered to assist people in
4817=helping that.  I met with the legal women voters.  I
4818=met with Think Tennessee before we had any data on
fmt=pb
4819=their brief that they did just to get people
4820=interested.  But at the end of the day we had four
4821=plans submitted.  When we took up those plans in
4822=December then, we had not only those four plans to
4823=discuss but then the Democratic caucus also had a
4824=plan.
4825=               I think that's sort of the process of
4826=what a normal process would look like without COVID
4827=and then also at the end there sort of what the
4828=process has looked like in the past redistricting
4829=cycles of a committee, an opportunity for the public
4830=to submit plans.  This time we had more public
4831=hearings than we had ever had.
4832=               We did not get to do meetings around
4833=the state, which was hopefully a goal that we can do
4834=the next census time, but it wasn't possible because
4835=of the COVID restrictions that we had at the time.
4836=But that's essentially how we got from what we had
4837=in the past and how we got to this plan.
4838=     Q    Was your contact information on the
4839=General Assembly's website?
4840=     A    Yes, it was.  And what we did -- and this
4841=is the difference between -- this is why I said we
4842=put more out there this time.  Ten years ago, after
4843=the 2010 census, we had a redistricting hotline,
fmt=pb
4844=which we had a phone that you could record a message
4845=on, and we had only one message ever, and it was a
4846=clerk at the time testing it to see if it worked.
4847=               So we felt that this time, I felt
4848=that it was important when we put the website out
4849=there that the people had a real contact.  So we put
4850=my name, my phone number, my office address, my
4851=email all straight to me and only me.  And I had
4852=contact.  We had people call from around the state,
4853=Women Voters, Think Tennessee.  And I was able to
4854=have that contact with those people leading up to
4855=it.  And I participated in some of their forums that
4856=they had just to get the topic out there and get
4857=people talking about it.
4858=     Q    Do you have any recollection of whether or
4859=not any of the Plaintiffs in this case attempted to
4860=contact you?
4861=     A    I do not believe that either of the
4862=Plaintiffs in this case contacted me.
4863=     Q    Okay.  We'll come back to the enacted map,
4864=but I would like to start with your expert report
4865=since we have got that in front of you.  In your
4866=role as an expert in this case, did you review
4867=alternative plans provided by Dr. Cervas?
4868=     A    I did.
fmt=pb
4869=     Q    How did you review his alternative maps?
4870=     A    As those reports were submitted over the
4871=course of a year, I would go to the report, look at
4872=the map that was in the report but then follow the
4873=link, the link that was a link to Dave's.  From
4874=Dave's, I would export report the CSV file where I
4875=could then import it into Maptitude, which is the
4876=program that the House of Representatives uses to do
4877=the redistricting and the GIS, which is a bit more
4878=technical and probably a little bit more
4879=sophisticated tool than what Dave's is.
4880=     Q    So what are your thoughts, if any, on
4881=Dave's Redistricting?
4882=     A    So, I think Dave's is a fun -- it's a fun
4883=website to play with.  You can entertain yourself by
4884=going to any state and draw a congressional plan for
4885=Arizona, and it's kind of a fun thing to do.  I
4886=would not use it in any professional capacity.
4887=               And I also don't like it for the fact
4888=that unlike how the house does redistricting, Dave's
4889=has a lot of information, as do some of the other
4890=public platforms, that are more of a partisan
4891=nature, scoring districts.  They have factors in
4892=Dave's and the others that have nothing to do with
4893=Tennessee redistricting.  While I think it's a
fmt=pb
4894=useful tool, I think that sometimes those tools can
4895=confuse folks, as well, and makes it a little bit
4896=more partisan that it needs to be.
4897=     Q    What do you use?
4898=     A    Maptitude exclusively.
4899=     Q    Why do you exclusively use Maptitude?
4900=     A    Because I have confidence in its
4901=reliability.  I have confidence in the track record
4902=that we have with that program in Tennessee.  Ellen
4903=Tewes, who I mentioned, the former director of legal
4904=services, worked with the developers of Maptitude
4905=when they were just getting into the redistricting
4906=field.  There's not many professional programs out
4907=there, but Maptitude is probably one of the five
4908=star ones.
4909=     Q    Do you know, if there are any, any of
4910=Maptitude's clients?
4911=     A    So, Maptitude has been used by the Census
4912=Bureau, the Department of Justice, multiple states,
4913=multiple local governments.  In my opinion, it's the
4914=gold standard of redistricting tools.
4915=     Q    Mr. Himes, if I could direct your
4916=attention to Page 19 of your expert report.  Did you
4917=review in your role as an expert Cervas Plan 13a?
4918=     A    I did.
fmt=pb
4919=     Q    And did you form an opinion about that
4920=map?
4921=     A    I did.
4922=     Q    What was your opinion?
4923=     A    Is it okay if I refer us to Page 41 of my
4924=expert report?
4925=     Q    Certainly.
4926=     A    It's a little bit easier.  So, all the
4927=plans that the house had and with the Cervas one, I
4928=tried to copy the same sort of format that's a basic
4929=evaluation of how plans are evaluated on the house
4930=side.  It's traditionally what we have used for the
4931=last three redistrictings.  And that is to look at
4932=whether it's a statewide plan, and 13a is.  It has
4933=99 districts.  It had 12 majority-minority
4934=districts, which is one less than both the 2010 plan
4935=and what the 2020 enacted plan in 598 has.
4936=               It has a population range of 9.96
4937=percent.  Its overall range of population, which is
4938=higher than what the 598 was enacted with, 9.90.  It
4939=split 24 counties.  It was not contiguous.  There
4940=were bits that were not assigned correctly to the
4941=districts they could have been or should have been
4942=assigned to.  And it paired 15 incumbents.  And both
4943=of those factors, the contiguity and the incumbent
fmt=pb
4944=pairing that is illustrated in footnotes, and it's
4945=the same standard evaluation that would have been
4946=used on the four public plans, the Democratic caucus
4947=plan, and then also the house plan.
4948=     Q    In your expert opinion, do you think that
4949=the 12 majority-minority districts poses a problem
4950=compared to the Enacted maps 13?
4951=     A    It poses a significant litigation risk,
4952=and I would not recommend this plan to the House of
4953=Representatives.
4954=     Q    How does it pose a litigation risk?
4955=     A    It dilutes majority-minority voting
4956=districts from 13 to 12.  This particular plan
4957=eliminates the Rural West Tennessee district, which
4958=is a significant problem.
4959=     Q    Who represents that district?
4960=     A    Currently and historically it's been
4961=Representative Johnny Shaw.
4962=     Q    If we want to move on to the next page,
4963=Page 42.  Did you review Cervas Concept 13b?
4964=     A    I did.
4965=     Q    Did you form an opinion about Cervas
4966=Concept 13b?
4967=     A    Yes.
4968=     Q    What was that opinion?
fmt=pb
4969=     A    So this one, too, not did comply with the
4970=Constitution.  It had a little bit better -- we
4971=talked a little bit yesterday about
4972=majority-minority districts and what's the proper
4973=metric:  Is it voting age population, either a
4974=single race or ethnicity or a multirace, any part
4975=minority or ethnicity?
4976=               As I mentioned, the house has
4977=historically looked at these as single race.
4978=There's also the multirace, any part.  And I don't
4979=know if either one of them is wrong.  We look at
4980=them and scored all these plans when we went through
4981=it based on the single race.  We would have counted
4982=it the same under a multirace.
4983=               And under a multirace category, any
4984=part African American in this case, District 80, is
4985=50.94 percent voting age any part African American.
4986=Under single race, 49.54 percent.  So, it satisfies
4987=the majority-minority district perhaps.  It's pretty
4988=close.  And depending on the turn out of an
4989=election, you don't know.  But giving the benefit of
4990=the doubt, it's very close to the 13
4991=majority-minority districts.
4992=               But 13b has a higher overall range of
4993=9.9.6 percent.  It splits 25 counties.  But the
fmt=pb
4994=significant thing here with the splits is it splits
4995=Madison County.  Madison County is sufficient enough
4996=that has population that has enough for one full
4997=district, and it's always had one full district.
4998=And it's significant in the way that it also helps
4999=us comply in Rural West Tennessee with the Voting
5000=Rights Act.  It has historically been since Rural
5001=West one of the counties included in the District
5002=80, which is represented by Representative Shaw.
5003=               So while this plan almost creates a
5004=majority-minority district in West Tennessee, it
5005=does it also by splitting Madison and not giving
5006=Madison County a full representative, and I think
5007=that's a significant problem.  It's not contiguous.
5008=There were a number of census blocks that were not
5009=assigned correctly.  And it also paired 30
5010=incumbents.
5011=     Q    Can you walk us through in a little bit
5012=more detail and explain the difference between using
5013=any part of racial identification versus the
5014=alternative?
5015=     A    Sure.  So, folks can respond to the census
5016=however they like or not at all, unfortunately.  But
5017=when it comes to the race and ethnicity and race in
5018=particular, folks can select any combination of
fmt=pb
5019=races.  A person can put white, black, Asian and
5020=that's perfectly acceptable.  Under any part African
5021=American, which is what we are concerned with in
5022=Tennessee, because it's the one racial minority that
5023=is sufficient enough in population and compact
5024=enough to have a majority-minority district.
5025=               You can have any part African
5026=American.  Somebody could respond white and black
5027=and that would be counted that way.  Using black
5028=alone, which is the category the Census Bureau has,
5029=the person who responded white black or Asian black
5030=would not be included.  It's just the people who
5031=respond a single race of African American.
5032=               Does that help?
5033=     Q    It does.  And help me out with this.  So
5034=if you take all of the any part responses, do they
5035=add up to 100 percent or would it be greater?
5036=     A    You might have to help me with what you
5037=are asking.
5038=     Q    We'll come back to it.  We'll move along.
5039=If I could direct you to Page 43.  Did you review
5040=Cervas house Concept 14a?
5041=     A    I did.
5042=     Q    Did you form an opinion about it?
5043=     A    I did.
fmt=pb
5044=     Q    And what's your opinion?
5045=     A    So 14a was a plan that instead of doing --
5046=I think the difference between the 13s and the 14s
5047=are the number of districts in Shelby County.  So
5048=the 13s have 13 districts in Shelby County, which is
5049=the number that are in Chapter 598.  And the 14s
5050=have 14 districts in Shelby County.  I would note
5051=just to start, this one, too, has the
5052=majority-minority districts.
5053=               You know, under the evaluation, it's
5054=scored 12 majority-minority districts.  You will see
5055=in the footnote the explanation again that using the
5056=any part black designation, you can see how that
5057=changes some of the districts when you look at them.
5058=And again, those are majority-minority districts.  I
5059=would say that many of those that are created in 14a
5060=are very narrowly majority-minority districts within
5061=a very, very small range of 50 percent plus one.
5062=This plan has an even higher overall range of
5063=9.98 percent, and it splits 24 counties.
5064=               But again, like the previous plan, it
5065=splits Madison County.  It doesn't create that full
5066=district in Madison County, which is something that
5067=the house has always strived to have.  Full counties
5068=have their one representative.  If they are a whole
fmt=pb
5069=county, have it.  If they divide evenly into two, to
5070=have those two without splitting them.  But if they
5071=have too much population for two, to create that
5072=full district.  And this plan does not create that
5073=full district.
5074=               It's not contiguous.  It also has
5075=problems with the contiguity.  And it pairs even
5076=more incumbents together at 41.
5077=     Q    So far we have seen in these concepts,
5078=9.96 in two maps and 9.98 percent for the overall
5079=range.  Does Tennessee safely stay under 10 percent?
5080=     A    No.
5081=     Q    Why not?
5082=     A    It's not a bright line.  There needs to be
5083=equal -- sorry.  Equal population is again that top
5084=standard that every plan is trying to achieve.  And
5085=the lower you get, the closer to zero you get, the
5086=better.  But there are going to be in state
5087=Legislative districting, you are allowed some
5088=variance, as long as there's justification for it.
5089=But it should be as low as you can.  Anything higher
5090=is a litigation risk.
5091=     Q    If I could get you to turn the page.  Look
5092=at Page 44.  Did you review Cervas house Concept
5093=13.5a?
fmt=pb
5094=     A    I did.
5095=     Q    Did you form an opinion about it?
5096=     A    Yes, I did.
5097=     Q    And what was that opinion?
5098=     A    This particular Concept had probably some
5099=of the more significant problems of any of the
5100=concepts.  I would not recommend it to be a guide
5101=for anyone.  13.5 and the plans that are 13.5
5102=signify splitting of Shelby County.
5103=               Shelby County doesn't need to be
5104=split.  It's a whole county that either has 13 or 14
5105=districts in that fall within that overall range of
5106=a 10 percent.  13 districts is actually closer to
5107=the ideal than 14 district, the 13.  But 13.5,
5108=having half the population exit the county and split
5109=the county, there's just not a justification for it.
5110=               In fact, if anything is clear in the
5111=Article 2, Section 5 of the Constitution, I think
5112=the second sentence says that in counties that can
5113=have more than one representative, that they be
5114=divided evenly into districts.  So this from just a
5115=basic start is a faulty concept in my opinion.
5116=               But more importantly using the most
5117=favorable metric any part black population, it only
5118=creates 11 majority-minority districts.  It also
fmt=pb
5119=splits beyond Shelby County.  It continues the split
5120=in Madison County.  It doesn't create that full
5121=district in Madison.  It has a significant number of
5122=noncontiguity issues throughout the plan, in
5123=particular, quiet a few in Shelby County.  And it
5124=pairs 35 incumbents at the end of the day.
5125=     Q    In the past four maps that we have
5126=discussed, have they all been the same high
5127=deviation of 5.09 percent?
5128=     A    Yes.
5129=     Q    What is the enacted map's high
5130=deviation percentage?
5131=     A    The same, 5.09 percent.
5132=     Q    What explains why all of those are the
5133=same?
5134=     A    These four concepts, along with Chapter
5135=598, all maintain the boundary of Montgomery County.
5136=Again, you have a whole county that's devisable very
5137=close to that standard five and five deviation.
5138=Montgomery can be divided into three complete
5139=districts within the county boundary without
5140=splitting it.  And it takes you to that high of
5141=5.09.
5142=     Q    Okay.  If I could get you to flip to the
5143=next page.  Did you have an opportunity to review
fmt=pb
5144=house Concept 13.5b?
5145=     A    I did.
5146=     Q    Did you form an opinion about it?
5147=     A    I have.
5148=     Q    And what is that opinion?
5149=     A    That I would not use this plan.  I would
5150=not recommend this plan as a guide either primarily
5151=for the unnecessary split of Shelby County.
5152=               This does have some positives to it,
5153=this plan.  It's 11 majority-minority districts
5154=under a single race, black alone analysis.  But
5155=using any part African American it does equal the
5156=plan that's 13, but again they are very close to
5157=50 percent plus one.  It has a slightly better
5158=overall range.
5159=               But again, it splits Shelby and
5160=splits Madison.  It does not provide for that full
5161=district in Madison County.  It has a significant
5162=number of noncontiguous areas and it pairs 39
5163=incumbents.
5164=     Q    Is it fair to say that all of these maps
5165=that we just discussed would create additional
5166=litigation risks for the state of Tennessee?
5167=     A    I think it's fair to say that.  And I
5168=would also say that none of them are constitutional
fmt=pb
5169=just based on the fact that they are noncontiguous.
5170=     Q    All right.  If we could leave your expert
5171=report behind, and if we could take a look at
5172=Exhibit 89.
5173=     A    I'm there.
5174=     Q    All right.  Are you familiar with this
5175=exhibit?
5176=     A    I am.
5177=     Q    And what is it?
5178=     A    It is an affidavit from myself regarding a
5179=rebuttal report of the Plaintiffs' expert and a
5180=January 9th response to Defendants' expert
5181=deposition.  So it was a report that was filed by
5182=the Plaintiffs' expert in rebuttal.
5183=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, at this time we
5184=     would like to move this into evidence if it's
5185=     not already as Exhibit 87.  And we understand
5186=     there's no objection.
5187=          MR. TIFT:  I think it's 89.
5188=          MR. RIEGER:  I apologize, 89.
5189=          CHIEF JUDGE:  It is admitted without
5190=     objection.
5191=
5192=                       - - -
5193=
fmt=pb
5194=                              (The above-referred to
5195=                              document was thereupon
5196=                              marked Defendant Exhibit
5197=                              No. 89, and is attached
5198=                              hereto.)
5199=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) Now, if I could please
5200=direct you to Exhibit A of that exhibit.  Did you
5201=review Dr. Cervas' map 13c?
5202=     A    I did do that.
5203=     Q    Did you form an opinion about that map?
5204=     A    I did.
5205=     Q    And what was that opinion?
5206=     A    That 13c did have 13 majority-minority
5207=districts, had a higher overall range, split 24
5208=counties, was contiguous, and had no unassigned
5209=areas.
5210=     Q    And how did that compare to the enacted
5211=house map?
5212=     A    It has a higher overall range of
5213=population than the house map and splits less
5214=counties.
5215=     Q    Would you agree with the statement that it
5216=is a tradeoff between deviation and county splits?
5217=     A    That can be a factor of having a higher
5218=overall deviation by reducing the number of county
5219=splits.
5220=     Q    Do you think this map does that?
fmt=pb
5221=     A    Yes.  I do believe it does raise the range
5222=and lowers the splits.
5223=     Q    Do you believe that this map trades a
5224=higher litigation risk on deviation for a greater
5225=litigation risk on county splitting?
5226=     A    The rise in population overall deviation
5227=would create a risk that you would have to consider.
5228=     Q    If I could get you to turn the page to
5229=Exhibit B to Exhibit 89.  Did you have an
5230=opportunity to review Dr. Cervas' house Concept 13d?
5231=     A    13d, yes, I did review it.
5232=     Q    Did you form an opinion about that map?
5233=     A    Yes, I did.
5234=     Q    What is it?
5235=     A    It creates 13 majority-minority districts.
5236=It's overall range is slightly better than the house
5237=enacted plan at 9.89 percent.  It splits 24 counties
5238=and it's important to note that it double splits
5239=Sullivan County and that's a not insignificant
5240=issue.  What I mean by double split is Madison is
5241=big enough to have one full district and has excess
5242=population, and currently that makes up part of the
5243=majority-minority district, District 80.
5244=               In Sullivan County, there's enough
5245=population for two complete districts, and then
fmt=pb
5246=there's this extra population that needs to be
5247=attached somewhere else.  Instead of creating those
5248=two districts, this plan splits Sullivan in a way
5249=that part of the population goes one direction, and
5250=part of the population goes in another direction.
5251=And we have consistently split counties if they have
5252=to be split only a single time.  We don't double
5253=split.  And it's an issue.  This was an issue just
5254=because of the census data.
5255=               If you think about upper, East
5256=Tennessee, Washington County came back as a perfect
5257=two districts.  It's a county that has a population
5258=that if you divide that population evenly, you are
5259=going to have two districts that fall within the
5260=range, so we're not going to split that.  Washington
5261=County has a stop sign.  And then right below
5262=Washington is Greene County, which grew a little bit
5263=unexpectedly, but it moved itself into a single
5264=district county.  It fell within that range.
5265=Another stop sign.
5266=               So you had Unicoi and Carter and
5267=Johnson, and it forces that population.  There's too
5268=much.  There's like an extra half a district.  And
5269=it's a puzzle.  What do you do with it?  Without
5270=splitting a whole county that has perfect
fmt=pb
5271=population, you have to exit through the bottom of
5272=Sullivan.  And the enacted plan does do it that way,
5273=and many of the Plaintiffs' experts plans do it this
5274=way.
5275=               For some reason, this reverts back to
5276=a double split of Sullivan and doesn't do that.  But
5277=there's no other way to do that.  And that drives
5278=county splitting for quite a bit of East Tennessee,
5279=just the fact that there's extra population up there
5280=that has to come out.  So that's probably the most
5281=significant problem with 13d, and it also was not
5282=contiguous.  There were a few census blocks,
5283=including populated census blocks, that were not
5284=assigned correctly.
5285=     Q    And if I could get you to turn the page,
5286=did you have an opportunity to review Dr. Cervas'
5287=house Concept 13d_e?
5288=     A    I did.
5289=     Q    Did you form an opinion about that map?
5290=     A    I did.
5291=     Q    What was that opinion?
5292=     A    So 13d_e was a plan that created 13
5293=majority-minority districts, was slightly, you know,
5294=9.89 instead of an 9.90 overall range, a split 24
5295=counties, but again, was not contiguous.  And it
fmt=pb
5296=solved the problem of Sullivan County, but in doing
5297=so, there were a couple blocks up there that weren't
5298=contiguous.
5299=     Q    In your opinion, are either of these three
5300=maps acceptable alternatives to the enacted house
5301=map?
5302=     A    So d and d_e are clearly not.  C is one
5303=that, you know, has a litigation risk that you would
5304=have to think about, but somebody could consider it.
5305=And I don't have on here, unfortunately, the number
5306=of incumbents that were paired in this one, and I do
5307=not recall what it was.
5308=     Q    So just to make sure I've got it correct,
5309=is it your opinion that d and d_e are unacceptable
5310=and that c requires a tradeoff?
5311=     A    That's correct.
5312=     Q    Did you review any of Dr. Cervas' maps
5313=that were presented during the temporary injunction
5314=phase of this case?
5315=     A    I did.
5316=     Q    What were your thoughts about those?
5317=     A    Those maps were not useful in
5318=illustrations of alternative concepts.
5319=     Q    Why not?
5320=     A    There was multiple issues, and I think I
fmt=pb
5321=provided an affidavit at the time with some of the
5322=issues.  There were contiguity problems, double
5323=splitting, shapes that were unusual, to say the
5324=least.
5325=     Q    As an expert in Tennessee Redistricting
5326=Law procedures and practices, did you form an
5327=opinion about Dr. Cervas' work as an expert in this
5328=case?
5329=     A    I believe I have.
5330=     Q    What was it?
5331=     A    And I would say this with all due respect
5332=to Dr. Cervas, I don't know if his plans are useful
5333=alternatives.  I think some of the errors that
5334=continue throughout.  The contiguity after being
5335=pointed out throughout the stages of this, it
5336=surprised me that that was continued throughout it.
5337=The double splitting issues were pointed out at the
5338=beginning of this and then would reappear.  And I
5339=think that's problematic, as well.
5340=               I think to the extent that they are
5341=illustrative of a plan that may split fewer
5342=counties, I think I have said that -- I have said
5343=yesterday and I'll say it again.  I think
5344=theoretically it's possible, but I don't think that
5345=that precludes any plan.  I think they can all be
fmt=pb
5346=constitutional in the sense of in that trading off
5347=that folks have.  And that's part of the discretion.
5348=But I don't think that these plans are as useful as
5349=they could be.
5350=     Q    Is there anything else that you have an
5351=expert opinion about regarding anything that is
5352=related to the alternative maps or performance of
5353=Dr. Cervas that we have not covered?
5354=     A    I think that's probably all I would say.
5355=I understand that Dr. Cervas is not an attorney,
5356=and I think some of the analysis of a
5357=majority-minority district is probably a little bit
5358=outside of his expertise.  But as to the plans that
5359=were presented, I just don't know if they are that
5360=helpful at the end of the day.
5361=     Q    Do you believe that it takes a great deal
5362=of knowledge about Tennessee Law and Tennessee
5363=geography and Tennessee demographics to draw a
5364=constitutional map?
5365=     A    I think it's extremely important.  I think
5366=that is a hurdle.  There's very few people that have
5367=worked in Tennessee in redistricting and have the
5368=experience of working in a state that has the unique
5369=geographical features than we have, has unique
5370=population demographics, has historical districts
fmt=pb
5371=and historical representation that you don't get
5372=when you just look at something from a snapshot.
5373=               Tennessee is not New York.  Tennessee
5374=is not Pennsylvania.  Tennessee is not Virginia.  I
5375=would not do a good job drawing districts for the
5376=Nebraska senate.  There's one house there, but I
5377=wouldn't be good at that.  You wouldn't have to
5378=worry about some of the factors that we have in
5379=Tennessee.  But every state has different
5380=considerations, and I think it takes some time to
5381=understand what those considerations are and how to
5382=balance them all.
5383=               Like I said, I wouldn't make a good
5384=expert in another state, and I think that it's
5385=important that when drawing redistricting plans,
5386=that someone have an understanding of the state and
5387=the history of the state and the history of
5388=redistricting in that state.
5389=     Q    Would that history necessarily include the
5390=Tennessee judiciary's guidance on how they interpret
5391=Tennessee constitutional requirements?
5392=     A    Of course.
5393=     Q    Would you expect that an expert would need
5394=to familiarize themselves with the holdings of the
5395=Tennessee Supreme Court in order to properly design
fmt=pb
5396=a constitutional map?
5397=     A    Yes.  I think an expert would need to
5398=understand what those are or have the
5399=particularities of Tennessee explained to them.  I
5400=don't think you could just draw Tennessee just to
5401=draw it.  I don't think a citizen in California can
5402=go up to Dave's and draw a plan of Tennessee and
5403=without any knowledge of Tennessee, provide anything
5404=that's useful.
5405=     Q    Would you expect an expert to read
5406=Tennessee Case Law in redistricting?
5407=     A    I would expect that, yes.
5408=     Q    Would you as an expert think that it was
5409=enough to simply read Lockert I?
5410=     A    No.
5411=     Q    Why not?
5412=     A    Because I think you need to -- first, I
5413=would start off with reading the constitutional
5414=provisions.  I would want to try to have an
5415=understanding of that, Article 2, Section 4; Article
5416=2, Section 5.  Then, I think I would want to look at
5417=all the case Law, not just Lockert I, but the
5418=Lockert trilogy.  I would want to read and
5419=understand Lincoln County.  I would want to
5420=understand more for the part of it that helps us
fmt=pb
5421=understand county splitting.  I would want to look
5422=at Rural West Tennessee cases to make sure I had an
5423=understanding of the very complicated history that
5424=the state of Tennessee has had with the compliance
5425=of Voting Rights Act.  And those would be the
5426=minimal cases.
5427=     Q    I would like to ask you a few questions
5428=about Lockert II, if I could.  Have you read Lockert
5429=II?
5430=     A    I have.
5431=     Q    Okay.  Did the Chancery Court in Lockert
5432=II find that there was an optimal number of counties
5433=that could be split?
5434=     A    Yes.  I felt that they were around 25 is
5435=what they were looking at.
5436=     Q    Is your understanding of Lockert II that
5437=the Tennessee Supreme Court required that the state
5438=stick to that 25?
5439=     A    No.
5440=     Q    Have you read Lincoln County v. Crowell?
5441=     A    I have.
5442=     Q    Did that case involve a split of both
5443=Lincoln and Marshall Counties?
5444=     A    It did.
5445=     Q    Was the Supreme Court presented in that
fmt=pb
5446=case with a map that only split one of those two?
5447=     A    It seems when you read that opinion that
5448=it was offered in some way that that four county
5449=area that was part of the case could have only one
5450=split.  And that's in the opinion.
5451=     Q    Did the Supreme Court invalidate the map?
5452=     A    They did not.
5453=     Q    Okay.  Is it your understanding as an
5454=expert that perfection is not required?
5455=     A    That is my understanding.
5456=     Q    At this point if you could, I would like
5457=you to take off your expert cap for us, and I want
5458=to ask you some factually-based questions about your
5459=experience with the enacted house map.
5460=     A    Okay.
5461=     Q    Now, can you walk us through the
5462=Legislative process about how the map we are talking
5463=about today got enacted?
5464=     A    How Chapter 598 got enacted?
5465=     Q    Yes, sir.
5466=     A    So, 598 is based on the state level
5467=redistricting data that we received in mid-August of
5468=2021.  And once that data was received and once our
5469=vendor was able to put it in Maptitude, once we had
5470=the data just from the Census Bureau, I'm able to
fmt=pb
5471=pull out from the raw census data the county
5472=populations, because that's what we are getting when
5473=we get the state level redistricting data.  We are
5474=getting the county populations, the voting district
5475=populations.  We know them as precinct normally.  We
5476=can get those populations.  Then, we get the census
5477=block, which is the smallest level of census
5478=geography.
5479=               There's also block and some other
5480=geographies, but in Tennessee, we have traditionally
5481=used three levels, which is the county, VTD, and the
5482=census block.
5483=               But when we get that data, I will
5484=pool the county populations, and then I am able to
5485=look at those based on our state and what the ideal
5486=district is and see which counties are either whole
5487=on their own or evenly divide into multiple
5488=districts.  And that I can do as soon as I can pull
5489=that data.
5490=               And when you do that, there's ten.
5491=There's ten counties that come up in that category,
5492=and that's including Montgomery, which is going to
5493=then pool our plus minus 5 a little bit higher than
5494=a plus 5 to a plus 4.09.  But it's worth it because
5495=you are going to keep a county whole.  So there's
fmt=pb
5496=ten of those.
5497=               And then, I can also see from that
5498=initial just looking at the county level, you can
5499=see where the population growth is and where the
5500=population loss is.  And it was pretty significant.
5501=And after the 2010 census, we had eight counties
5502=that actually lost population.  But after the 2020
5503=census, we had 30 counties that lost population.
5504=And that's in my presentation I did to the
5505=committee.  There's a map that shows that loss.
5506=That was significant.  I have never seen that
5507=before, that many rural counties.
5508=               It's not just Tennessee.  A lot of
5509=States' rural populations are decreasing but
5510=significant for us.  Two-thirds of the counties in
5511=West Tennessee lost population, which is problematic
5512=when you are trying to make this work.
5513=               So looking at that data and looking
5514=at the 2010 data, just the county population, you
5515=can see the explosion of population around
5516=Nashville.  Nashville itself grew but it didn't grow
5517=in the way that was so significant that it created
5518=more districts within it than it had before.  What
5519=did happen is the suburban counties exploded in
5520=population, double-digit explosions all around
fmt=pb
5521=Nashville.
5522=               And you could see, at least knowing
5523=that Montgomery County was whole, it essentially
5524=contracted a district just within itself.  We knew
5525=from that county data, too, that Rutherford County
5526=grew enough from 2010 to 2020 to have a completely
5527=new district.  It had done the same thing a decade
5528=before.  So Rutherford has gone from three to four
5529=in 2010 to five full districts within its boundary
5530=after '20.  So, you know there's two there.  There's
5531=absolutely two.
5532=               Then, there's another district that
5533=the population has swollen around Nashville so much
5534=that you know there's going to be another district
5535=in Middle Tennessee.  And then, the legislature has
5536=discretion to figure out where that district is
5537=going to be.  And it's all based on population, and
5538=it's based on the census, and it's based on equal
5539=representation.  So, three districts to Middle
5540=Tennessee.
5541=               Then, the question becomes, where do
5542=those districts come from?  And that's a decision,
5543=again, that's within the discretion of the
5544=legislature, and it's based on this population
5545=shift.
fmt=pb
5546=               Shelby County, you have to look at
5547=it.  It divided evenly either 13 or 14.  But 13 is
5548=closer to the ideal number, so one of the districts
5549=would come from Shelby County.  We talked a little
5550=bit about the population bubble in upper, East
5551=Tennessee.  That's because of a loss of population,
5552=and that pushes the county splitting down to about
5553=Hamblen County.  Hamblen County, you've got to
5554=figure out what to do.  And that's where one of the
5555=districts came from, that general area.
5556=               And finally, I mentioned Montgomery
5557=County.  Montgomery County grew enough to
5558=essentially contract a district that had spilled
5559=outside of it.  That was a multicounty district
5560=within its boundary, which created a pressuring that
5561=with the loss of population in West Tennessee, with
5562=Montgomery County growing, that there is a
5563=contraction of a district in that part of the state
5564=in District 74 and 75.  So that's where districts
5565=are moving from.
5566=               And help me where you want me to go
5567=from here.
5568=     Q    Sure.  So, one question I have is was
5569=there any pressure -- earlier you testified about
5570=COVID 19 and the census data.  Was that unusual?
fmt=pb
5571=     A    Yes.  It was incredibly unusual because
5572=instead of having 11 months to work on this project
5573=and work with the members of the General Assembly
5574=with the eight criteria that the house uses in
5575=redistricting, we had five months.  And one of the
5576=things that was important in this process was not
5577=only to try to have more public meetings, to have
5578=more opportunities for public comment, to provide
5579=even with COVID as much as time as we could for
5580=people to submit plans to the General Assembly, was
5581=also to have this finished before we got into
5582=session so people could see it.
5583=               In the time I have been at the
5584=General Assembly, a redistricting plan has never
5585=been presented publicly before January 1st until
5586=this cycle.  And on December 17th, the committee
5587=published a plan for people to see.
5588=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, this might be a
5589=     good time to take a break; if that works?
5590=          CHIEF JUDGE:  All right.  Let's take about
5591=     ten minutes.
5592=                    [3:55 P.M., a recess was had
5593=                    until 4:13 P.M.]
5594=
5595=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honors, before we begin,
5596=     I do not think that we are going to conclude
fmt=pb
5597=     the Direct Examination today.  I just wanted to
5598=     make the Court aware of it.  I'll try to choose
5599=     a good stopping point as close to 5 as I can.
5600=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Good deal.
5601=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) Mr. Himes, please remember
5602=that you are still under oath.
5603=     A    I do.
5604=     Q    If I could get you to take a look at Tab
5605=No. 15.
5606=     A    (Witness complies.)
5607=     Q    Are you there?
5608=     A    I am there.
5609=     Q    Do you recognize this document?
5610=     A    This is an affidavit of myself from March
5611=of 2022.
5612=     Q    And I do not know if this has been
5613=admitted already, but if it has not, I would like to
5614=admit it as Exhibit 15.  And I don't believe there
5615=is an objection to it.
5616=          MR. TIFT:  No objection.  I'm not sure if
5617=     you admitted 14 earlier.
5618=          MR. RIEGER:  Yes, Your Honor.  If I had
5619=     not admitted Exhibit No. 14 at this time,
5620=     Defendants would ask to do so.
5621=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.  Exhibits 14 and 15
fmt=pb
5622=     are admitted into evidence without objection.
5623=                              (The above-referred to
5624=                              document was thereupon
5625=                              marked Defendant Exhibit
5626=                              No. 14, and is attached
5627=                              hereto.)
5628=
5629=                              (The above-referred to
5630=                              document was thereupon
5631=                              marked Defendant Exhibit
5632=                              No. 15, and is attached
5633=                              hereto.)
5634=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) Now, Mr. Himes, if I could
5635=get you to turn close to the back to a page that's
5636=entitled "General Redistricting Timetable."
5637=     A    I got it.
5638=     Q    Would you mind walking us through this
5639=information and explaining it a little bit?
5640=     A    Sure.  I would be happy to.  So this would
5641=be something that would be prepared after any census
5642=during the decades I have worked in redistricting
5643=just to give the committee members and the public an
5644=opportunity to know sort of what the timeline is for
5645=what's ahead of them.
5646=               And so in 2020, this just reflects
5647=after that census that this timetable -- it's when
5648=the second annual session of the 112th General
5649=Assembly at the time was scheduled to come back,
5650=which was Tuesday, January 11th, 2022.  So this was
fmt=pb
5651=the PowerPoint that was presented to the select
5652=committee on redistricting at the September meeting
5653=at that initial meeting.  So I'm going through this
5654=timetable with them.  So, they will convene again in
5655=January.  And then I put out some deadlines, the
5656=qualifying deadline and then some days out from
5657=qualify.
5658=               Because it's important that a
5659=redistricting plan in any decade become law as soon
5660=after session starts as possible to give citizens an
5661=opportunity to know what districts they are in, to
5662=give candidates an opportunity to know if they want
5663=to run in those districts, and to give the election
5664=coordinators and staff an opportunity to make sure
5665=that folks are assigned to the right districts.
5666=               So, I put the qualifying deadline as
5667=the drop deadline, which is in statute, the
5668=Thursday, April 7, 2022.  That would be where you
5669=didn't want to get to.  Obviously, a bill could be
5670=passed to change that qualifying deadline, but if
5671=you were getting redistricting that close, it would
5672=be problematic for a lot of reasons.
5673=               Then, I just gave them some dates:
5674=90-days out from qualify, which was Friday,
5675=January 7th, 2022, which is before they convene;
fmt=pb
5676=60-days out from qualifying Sunday, February 6,
5677=2022; and 30-days out from qualifying, March 8,
5678=2022.  That just, again, to give them some knowledge
5679=about when these dates are and hopefully hit between
5680=the 90 and the 60 days to give people the
5681=opportunity to know the districts, the coordinators
5682=the chance to get them in the system.
5683=               And then, also, just the primary and
5684=general election dates for 2022, which are
5685=August 4th and November 8th of 2022.
5686=     Q    Earlier you spoke about COVID 19 and the
5687=census data.  Did that create additional pressure in
5688=meeting your goals of having a map between the
5689=90-days and 60-days out from the qualifying
5690=deadline?
5691=     A    Yes, it put pressure on the committee and
5692=it put pressure on me, the committee's counsel,
5693=because it compressed the schedule, not this
5694=schedule.  The qualifying deadline is what it is.
5695=But what it did compress was the time that the
5696=committee had to get the data, to analyze the data,
5697=and pass a constitutional plan.  Instead of the 11
5698=months roughly that they would have, we had five
5699=months if we were going to put it out as soon as we
5700=could, which the goal was to do it before Christmas.
fmt=pb
5701=     Q    During the legislative process, did anyone
5702=submit house maps for consideration?
5703=     A    Are you saying, did people submit plans to
5704=be considered?
5705=     Q    Yes.
5706=     A    Yes.
5707=     Q    If I could get you to turn to Exhibit No.
5708=23.
5709=     A    I'm there.
5710=     Q    Are you familiar with that document?
5711=     A    I am.
5712=     Q    What is it?
5713=     A    It is the concept that was submitted by
5714=Brett Windrow.  It's a house map.
5715=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, at this time, we
5716=     would like to introduce this into evidence as
5717=     Exhibit 23.
5718=          MR. TIFT:  No objection.
5719=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibit 23 is admitted
5720=     without objection.
5721=                              (The above-referred to
5722=                              document was thereupon

5725=                              hereto.)
5726=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) And we'll talk about this
5727=a little bit more later, but if I could get you to
fmt=pb
5728=turn to Exhibit 24.  Are you familiar with this
5729=document?
5730=     A    I am.
5731=     Q    What is it?
5732=     A    Both 24, the Brett Windrow concept --
5733=these were the four plans that were publicly
5734=submitted by the November 12th, 2022 deadline to the
5735=house, to committee.  So Exhibit 24 is the house
5736=concept that was submitted by four gentlemen from, I
5737=believe, Memphis: Mr. Cardell Orrin, Aerris Newton,
5738=Jeffrey Lichtenstein, and Kermit Moore.
5739=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, we would like to
5740=     submit that as Exhibit 24.
5741=          MR. TIFT:  No objection.
5742=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibit 24 is admitted

5751=     A    Yes.
5752=     Q    Are you familiar with this document?
5753=     A    I am.  This is another plan of one of the
5754=four.  It's a house plan with 99 districts submitted

5787=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) Apart from those four maps
5788=and, of course, the enacted house map, did anyone
5789=else submit a map for consideration?
5790=     A    Yes.
5791=     Q    Who?
5792=     A    The Democratic caucus submitted a concept
5793=for the December 17th meeting.
5794=     Q    Any other maps besides that single map?
5795=     A    That were submitted and were considered by
5796=the house, no.
5797=     Q    Now, if I could get you to return to
5798=Exhibit 15 for me and turn to the last set of
5799=documents that has a sticker in the corner, that
5800=says Exhibit Himes 4.
5801=     A    Yes, I'm there.
5802=     Q    And what are these documents, what are
5803=these pages?
5804=     A    So, these are the standard evaluations
5805=that have traditionally been prepared for all plans
5806=that are submitted to the house in the decades I
5807=have worked in redistricting.  And it's the same
5808=information that we saw earlier with some of the
fmt=pb
5809=plans that the Plaintiffs' expert -- evaluation of
5810=the same form as those that Plaintiffs' expert had
5811=submitted.  But these are the ones that were
5812=actually submitted by the committee.
5813=               And the only difference between these
5814=and the ones the Plaintiffs' expert submitted is you
5815=won't see these using the metric of any part African
5816=American.  These will be scored on the single race.
5817=At the time that's what the house used as a
5818=comparison from decade to decade.  Again, not saying
5819=using either one is right or wrong.  They both
5820=create majority-minority districts, but that's the
5821=only difference between the two.
5822=     Q    What if any were you thoughts on the Brett
5823=Windrow house concept map?
5824=     A    Well, I can read the evaluation.  I can
5825=say that it's not one that the house could consider.
5826=It wasn't constitutional.  It had multiple
5827=deficiencies.  It did create 99 districts, but it
5828=only created five majority-minority districts.
5829=               It had an overall population range of
5830=24.23 percent.  It had county splits that were equal
5831=26 but they were double splits.  It had splits of
5832=Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, Rutherford, and Shelby
5833=Counties, which were all whole counties that could
fmt=pb
5834=be divided within their boundary into multiple
5835=districts.  And then, Knox and Rutherford were
5836=double split, so you have that issue of pieces of
5837=the county going in different directions and being
5838=attached to different districts.  It was not
5839=contiguous.  This one had multiple populated and
5840=unpopulated census blocks.  And it had unassigned
5841=areas.  And lastly, it paired 46 incumbents
5842=together.
5843=     Q    Okay.  If I could get you to turn the
5844=page.
5845=     A    (Witness complies.)
5846=     Q    And could you walk us through the
5847=evaluation of the Equity Alliance house concept?
5848=     A    Sure.  This concept, again, I would not
5849=recommend to the committee.  It had multiple
5850=constitutional deficiencies and major litigation
5851=risks.  It has 99 districts.  It created two
5852=majority-minority districts.  As it turned out, it
5853=had a better population deviation than the state
5854=house plan at 9.75 percent.
5855=               It split 30 counties and you can see
5856=in the footnote that it split multiple counties that
5857=were either double splits or triple splits, and
5858=then, I think Shelby County was a quintuple split of
fmt=pb
5859=Shelby.  It was forking off in multiple directions
5860=in various districts.  It was not contiguous.  It
5861=didn't have any unassigned areas.  And it paired 51
5862=of the 99 incumbents.
5863=     Q    So in terms of ranking the Equity Alliance
5864=map, was it your evaluation that the major issues
5865=for this Equity Alliance house concept that it
5866=reduced 13 majority-minority districts down to 2?
5867=     A    I believe that would have put us into
5868=Federal Court pretty quickly.
5869=     Q    Okay.  If I could get you to turn the page
5870=again.  And what were your thoughts on the Zach
5871=Wishart house concept map?
5872=     A    In fairness to Mr. Wishart, he wanted to
5873=withdraw this plan and not have it considered.  I
5874=think I say that in the transcript of that meeting.
5875=But it was already presented.  It was already
5876=publicly noticed.
5877=               And you'll notice that there's a
5878=member, and the member is the person that isn't the
5879=sponsor of it but -- and I should have explained
5880=this earlier.  It's a person who it's being put
5881=forward for that entity.  Just the citizens cannot
5882=introduce bills, and just like this process, there
5883=has to be somebody that will do it for a
fmt=pb
5884=constituent, and that was the case here.  In
5885=fairness to him, he did not want this considered.
5886=               So this was a state-wide plan.  It
5887=had 99 districts.  It had 6 majority-minority
5888=districts.  It had a 9.02 percent overall range.  It
5889=split 30 counties, but it had a problem of double
5890=splitting counties and splitting counties that were
5891=whole on their own.  It triple, quadruple,
5892=quintuple, and Davidson County was sextuple split
5893=with different fingers going out in all different
5894=directions.  It was not contiguous.  It didn't have
5895=any unassigned areas, and it paired 26 incumbents.
5896=               And for the same reason as the
5897=previous one, I think one of the major concerns,
5898=besides the county splitting problems with this map,
5899=is the six majority-minority districts is
5900=problematic.
5901=     Q    And if I can get you to turn the page, and
5902=if you can give me your thoughts on the Orrin,
5903=Newton, Lichtenstein, and Moore house concept.
5904=     A    Yes.  This concept I don't think I would
5905=recommend as an alternative for multiple reasons,
5906=including the fact that it doesn't balance
5907=population equality and county splitting.  In fact,
5908=it makes both worse.
fmt=pb
5909=               It only created 10 majority-minority
5910=districts.  It's overall range was 19.28 percent.
5911=It split 58 of Tennessee's 95 counties, including
5912=the same problems of splitting counties that
5913=shouldn't be split because they are whole with
5914=either single and multiple districts and then also
5915=the problem of splitting counties up to four times
5916=in different directions.  Rutherford County was
5917=split that way.  It wasn't contiguous and it had
5918=unassigned areas that weren't populated and it
5919=paired 20 incumbents.
5920=     Q    And if I could get you to turn the page.
5921=     A    Uh-huh.
5922=     Q    And I believe the next two pages, there
5923=are two that are labeled Democratic caucus house
5924=concept.  The first one is listed as received at
5925=12:09 p.m. 11/12/21.  Can you describe why there are
5926=two in here?
5927=     A    Yes.  So, the public was able to submit
5928=from September 8th, the September meeting, until
5929=November 12th.  The public was able to submit plans
5930=until 12 noon on the 12th.  This plan was submitted
5931=after that deadline.  This was not considered, in
5932=fairness, by the committee but was publicly
5933=submitted.
fmt=pb
5934=               The second one was the revision to
5935=that first attempt, because members -- the caucus
5936=did not have to file this by the noon.  They had the
5937=latitude to be able to file it at the same time as
5938=the concept committee proposed, which was before
5939=that December 17th meeting.
5940=               So the difference is, the first one
5941=was the initial attempt at a public submission, but
5942=it was too late.  And the second one was the one
5943=that was submitted at the December 17th meeting.
5944=     Q    If you could tell us a little about your
5945=evaluation of the late-filed one.
5946=     A    So, the late-filed one had only eight
5947=majority-minority districts.  Again, these were
5948=evaluated, unlike the Plaintiffs' expert's opinions,
5949=these were evaluated as we were going through the
5950=process, so they are compared to the single race.
5951=So this wasn't compared to any part racial minority
5952=or ethnic minority.
5953=               But under a single race analysis is 8
5954=majority-minority districts.  And while the overall
5955=range was 6.71 percent, which is maybe the best of
5956=the ones that were publicly submitted, it split 35
5957=counties.  And some of those counties that were
5958=split were either whole counties that didn't have to
fmt=pb
5959=be split or were a double split, I believe, of
5960=several of these counties.  It was not contiguous
5961=was and it paired 24 incumbents.
5962=     Q    Okay.  And if I could get you to turn the
5963=page.
5964=     A    Uh-huh.
5965=     Q    And can you give us your thoughts on the
5966=Democratic caucus house concept that was considered?
5967=     A    Sure.  So, this was the concept that was
5968=considered at the December 17th meeting.  Statewide
5969=plan, 13 majority-minority districts, had an overall
5970=range of 9.72 percent, split 23 counties but
5971=importantly one of those counties was Shelby County.
5972=It was contiguous.  It did not have any unassigned
5973=areas, and it had 15 paired incumbents.
5974=               In fairness to the caucus, I think
5975=they may have not had the right location.  I don't
5976=think they wanted to do that. I think they wanted to
5977=do two less, but nonetheless it was 15 that were
5978=paired in the plan.  And the majority-minority
5979=districts, I just note that they were -- some of
5980=those districts were just barely over the 50 plus
5981=one percent voting age African American.
5982=     Q    Why do you think that they did not
5983=intended to pair 15 and instead pair 13 incumbents?
fmt=pb
5984=     A    There was a member in upper, East
5985=Tennessee had moved residences during the process,
5986=and I don't think that they understood that.
5987=     Q    Did anyone submit a map to the General
5988=Assembly apart, of course, we are not talking about
5989=the enacted house map.  But did anyone submit a map
5990=to the General Assembly that did not have clear
5991=constitutional problems?
5992=     A    No.
5993=     Q    Now, if I could turn you to Exhibit 20,
5994=and let's talk about the numbers.
5995=     A    I'm here.
5996=     Q    Do you know what this document is?
5997=     A    Yes.  Exhibit 20 appears to be the County
5998=Growth Table, which reflects the population growth
5999=from the 2010 census to the 2020 census, and then it
6000=states that as a percentage change either positive
6001=or negative.  And this was a document that is still
6002=on the General Assembly website and was presented to
6003=the committee.
6004=     Q    And if you could flip to the last two
6005=pages and identify that for us.
6006=     A    The last two pages is the census 2000
6007=population by county.
6008=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, at this time I
fmt=pb
6009=     would like to move Exhibit 20 into evidence.  I
6010=     understand that there is an objection to the
6011=     last two pages.
6012=          MR. TIFT:  There is no longer an
6013=     objection.  That's fine.
6014=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibit 20 is admitted into
6015=     evidence without objection.
6016=                              (The above-referred to
6017=                              document was thereupon
6018=                              marked Defendant Exhibit
6019=                              No. 20, and is attached
6020=                              hereto.)
6021=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) Can you explain where the
6022=numbers in the 2020 population column came from?
6023=     A    The results of the state level
6024=redistricting data.
6025=     Q    Is that the same data that is in
6026=Maptitude?
6027=     A    Yes.
6028=     Q    Is that answer the same for the 2010
6029=population column?
6030=     A    Yes.  2010 population would be the state
6031=level redistricting population for the counties that
6032=was reported in the 2010 census.
6033=     Q    And is that true for the last two pages,
6034=the 2000 census column?
6035=     A    That is true for that, as well.
fmt=pb
6036=     Q    Going back to the first page, can you
6037=explain the column that is marked percentage change
6038=10 to 20?
6039=     A    So, that's reflecting the difference that
6040=the two censuses reported.  And that's useful for
6041=the members from an initial standpoint to just see
6042=what counties they represent and see if they are
6043=losing or growing population.
6044=               So what you will see reflected here
6045=is what I talked about earlier, is that instead of
6046=just 8 negative growth, that we had 30 counties that
6047=actually lost population as reported in the 2020
6048=census.  And so, that reflects the percentage loss
6049=in those counties.  And in the ones that gained, it
6050=reflects that positive growth.  And the minus sign
6051=would be the negative growth ones.  There's not a
6052=plus sign for the positive.
6053=     Q    And if I could get you to turn to Exhibit
6054=22, please.
6055=     A    I'm there.
6056=     Q    Do you recognize this document?
6057=     A    I do.  Standard of the house after the
6058=census is to prepare a malapportionment table, and a
6059=malapportionment table reflects the census results
6060=that we received overlaid on top of the districts
fmt=pb
6061=that we have in place at that time.  It's going to
6062=show the 2012 districts with the 2020 census result
6063=population.  And it will show what the actual number
6064=is and then a percentage from that ideal of 69,806,
6065=whether they are above or below and a percentage of
6066=how much.
6067=               Since many times in this we are
6068=thinking about overall population, we are looking at
6069=what's five over and five below.  And this gives
6070=members an idea of where their district is and how
6071=much they either have to lose population or to gain
6072=population.
6073=               And you can see that there are some
6074=districts that exploded with population, especially
6075=in Rutherford County, which as I mentioned, gained
6076=an entire new district because of the census.  And
6077=then, you will see some of the West Tennessee
6078=districts that loss a significant amount of
6079=population, almost 20 percent below the ideal
6080=compared to 40 percent above the ideal in Rutherford
6081=County.
6082=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, at this time, we
6083=     would look to admit this as Exhibit 22.
6084=          MR. TIFT:  No objection.
6085=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibit 22 is admitted
fmt=pb
6086=     without objection.
6087=          MR. RIEGER:  Thank you.
6088=                              (The above-referred to
6089=                              document was thereupon
6090=                              marked Defendant Exhibit
6091=                              No. 22, and is attached
6092=                              hereto.)
6093=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) Mr. Himes, is it fair to
6094=say that if your district is a plus or minus
6095=five percent from ideal in this column, that the
6096=district is likely to have to change significantly?
6097=     A    Would you repeat that one?
6098=     Q    If in the plus or minus percentage column
6099=from ideal, if that number beside the minus and the
6100=positive sign is higher than five percent, does that
6101=reflect a problem that needs to be solved?
6102=     A    So I would say this.  This helps them with
6103=illustration but it's a snapshot.  Every one of
6104=these is a problem because it's a 99 district
6105=puzzle.  So you can be perfect.  I don't think there
6106=is a perfect one.  I'm just looking here.  You could
6107=be .36 percent positive, which is District 24, but
6108=your district may have to change.
6109=               It happens that that one did not
6110=change for core preservation and because of where
6111=it's located.  But just because you are at 40
6112=positive, yeah, you are going to have to lose
fmt=pb
6113=population.  But some of the ones that are in that
6114=range, even 5 percent, are going to have to change
6115=dramatically.
6116=     Q    Throughout this case, redistricting has
6117=been described as a puzzle, and we have had various
6118=witnesses speak on it.  If I could get you to put on
6119=your expert hat for one question.  How many
6120=solutions to Tennessee's redistricting puzzle are
6121=there?
6122=     A    How many solutions there, I don't think I
6123=can answer that.  Because I don't think that you
6124=would ever know.  I don't think you would ever have
6125=a perfect map.
6126=     Q    Would it be fair to say that there could
6127=be an infinite number of workable solutions to the
6128=puzzle?
6129=     A    Yes.
6130=     Q    Okay.  If you take your expert hat off
6131=again.  This number in parentheses in Exhibit 22
6132=that's next to the positive or minus percentage from
6133=ideal, 69,806, could you just one more time go over
6134=how we got there?
6135=     A    How we get to the percentages from ideal?
6136=     Q    Yes, please.
6137=     A    So, you are taking what the districts were
fmt=pb
6138=before the redistricting, so the 2012 districts that
6139=were drawn, and then taking the results of the
6140=census, they are reported and you can aggregate them
6141=by those old districts.  And you're measuring the
6142=new populations based on the 2020 census on those
6143=old lines.  And then, you are taking that number,
6144=dividing it from the ideal and getting
6145=that percentage of whether it's a positive or
6146=negative number.
6147=               You can do the raw math, as well. I
6148=think most of the member and most of the folks in
6149=redistricting are used to seeing this overall
6150=deviation.  I think it means more to them to see it
6151=as a percentage.  And that's why it's this way on
6152=this one. I think the percentage speaks a little bit
6153=louder than just the raw number.
6154=     Q    So, earlier we spoke about the high
6155=deviation number of 5.09 percent in a number of the
6156=Cervas concept maps.  And the enacted map had the
6157=same deviation, and you explained that was to keep
6158=Montgomery County whole.  What does that leave you
6159=for the low deviation?
6160=     A    I can tell you what it is in the enacted
6161=plan, but I don't think that's what you are asking.
6162=     Q    I'm asking if we use the 10 percent, not
fmt=pb
6163=bright line but guidance, from the federal cases
6164=what does that leave us?
6165=     A    It's going to be -- my math is not my
6166=necessarily my strong point, but I believe it would
6167=be 4.91 negative if you took it to the extreme. I
6168=think that adds up right.
6169=     Q    In your mind having a 4.91 percent low
6170=deviation safe?
6171=     A    No.
6172=     Q    Why not?
6173=     A    I mean, equal population is the number one
6174=thing in any plan.  And you want to balance those
6175=legitimate state interests and justify that
6176=deviation.  So, the low point should be justified by
6177=the districts that are on the map.  If you can keep
6178=it to the lowest low or the highest low, I guess it
6179=would be, it's better.
6180=               So, in Chapter 598, I think I
6181=mentioned the other day, the low districts are two
6182=that are composed of four counties with one split.
6183=And it's Districts 78 and 69, which are Cheatham,
6184=Dickson, Hickman, and Lewis Counties.  That
6185=combination with one split -- and the split is kind
6186=of we're backed up against a bunch of counties that
6187=are whole counties.  Cheatham has got to go
fmt=pb
6188=somewhere.  Those county combination takes you to
6189=4.81 negative.  And that's the lowest on this map in
6190=the enacted plan.
6191=               So instead of going and thinking,
6192=well, we could do a little bit lower here, this
6193=concept has it with this pairing and only one split
6194=of that area takes you to the negative 4.81.  And
6195=there's not a real good reason after that to justify
6196=going to the higher, the other 4.85 negative or even
6197=lower than that.  There's not a need to do that.  So
6198=try to keep it all on equal population and keep it
6199=as under 10 as you can get.
6200=          MR. RIEGER:  And, Your Honor, I'm about to
6201=     turn to another topic, but it is 4:50.  I
6202=     anticipate the topic will probably take -- we
6203=     are going to walk through the enacted map and
6204=     talk about every single split, so this might be
