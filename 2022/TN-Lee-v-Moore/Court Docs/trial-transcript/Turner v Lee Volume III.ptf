122=DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. RIEGER:
123=     Q    Mr. Himes, do you understand that you are
124=still under oath?
125=     A    I do.
126=     Q    Thank you.  So we ended yesterday talking
127=about the ideal number of the ideal district.  Can
128=you tell us what number is again?
129=     A    69,806 for a house district.
130=     Q    Now, we also spoke about the 5.09 percent
131=high deviation that the enacted map and several of
132=the Cervas maps have that is a result of keeping
133=Montgomery County whole.  Do you recall that?
fmt=pb
134=     A    I do.
135=     Q    Okay.  I would like to work through some
136=basic math with you if that's all right.  Is
137=5.09 percent above 69,806 equal to around 73,359?
138=     A    It is above 69,806.  I'm not as quick with
139=math in my head as what you are saying, but that
140=doesn't sound far off.
141=     Q    Okay.  Is 4.91 percent below 69,806
142=roughly equal to 66,378?
143=     A    With the same proviso, that sounds about
144=right, but I would want to do the math to make sure,
145=but that sounds about right.
146=     Q    Okay.  If we could turn to Exhibit 103,
147=please.
148=          MR. RIEGER:  And this is a demonstrative,
149=     Your Honor, so it will not be going into
150=     evidence.
151=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) Are you familiar with this
152=document, Mr. Himes?
153=     A    I am.
154=     Q    What is it?
155=     A    So, this is a three-page document that
156=lists the counties in alphabetical order.  In the
157=first column, it states "Population."  It lists
158=there the 2020 census result in the population, and
fmt=pb
159=it expresses it as the number that was reported by
160=the Census Bureau.  And it then goes across and
161=divides that population to tell you whether it's one
162=district, two districts, three districts, or four
163=districts as appropriate, what that total population
164=would be.
165=               So, for example, Anderson County has
166=77,123, so the yellow indicates that it has too many
167=people.  So, something has to be done with it.  In
168=this case, you know, it's going to be above even the
169=high of the 5.09.  So it will have to be split just
170=based on its population.  But the next column tells
171=you that if you divide that evenly into two
172=districts, that you would have 38,561, so it can't
173=be divided within itself.
174=               So, this table goes through that with
175=each county and the yellow is over.  The darker
176=orange is under.  And you can see that if you go
177=down to Carroll County it's 28,040.  It's too low to
178=even have a single district.  And then, the counties
179=that are in the pink under county are the 30
180=counties that have been divided under 598.  So it
181=gives you an idea of those that have been divided
182=and how it works out population wise.
183=     Q    How many counties in Tennessee can be kept
fmt=pb
184=whole or evenly divided amongst themselves and kept
185=alone?
186=     A    So taking the range to 5.09 percent,
187=there's ten counties.
188=     Q    Are all ten of those counties kept whole?
189=     A    They are.
190=     Q    Is it possible with some of the other
191=counties that you could simply put two of them
192=together and leave them both whole?
193=     A    It is possible.
194=     Q    How common is that?
195=     A    Since this is a puzzle that works together
196=from both ends of the state really, it just really
197=depends on where you are.  Under Chapter 598, you
198=get to a place in sort of southern, Middle Tennessee
199=where you are able to do a lot of keeping two
200=counties whole.  And it just shows you, the last
201=census that wasn't the case; this census it was.
202=It's just a different puzzle every time.
203=     Q    Are each of the ten counties that are able
204=to be kept whole just based on their numbers alone,
205=are they in the same geographic area in the state of
206=Tennessee?
207=     A    No.  I wish they were but they are not.
208=     Q    Why do you wish they were?
fmt=pb
209=     A    It would make the process a lot easier if
210=counties that were whole were grouped together and
211=you could start from one point and not have to work
212=around what I referred to yesterday as the stop
213=signs.  And the example I think I used yesterday
214=was northeast Tennessee where you have Washington
215=County with two full districts and Greene County
216=with one full district.  And you don't have a whole
217=lot of options of what you can do.  If one of those
218=two wasn't in that corner, you would have a lot more
219=opportunities to form districts.
220=     Q    So, Tennessee has 95 counties.  Minus ten,
221=that's 85.  Are those the numbers of puzzle pieces
222=that we are talking about?
223=     A    Yeah.  After you put the stop signs on
224=those ten, you wind up with the 85 counties
225=remaining.
226=     Q    And you were able to keep 55 counties
227=whole of those 85?
228=     A    That is correct.
229=     Q    If I could get you to turn to Exhibit 105,
230=which is another demonstrative, please.
231=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Does anybody object to
232=     demonstratives that are in the book behind a
233=     tab being marked for identification purposes
fmt=pb
234=     only?
235=          MR. TIFT:  No objection, Your Honor.
236=          MR. RIEGER:  No objection.
237=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Maybe we should do that.
238=          MR. RIEGER:  Then, Defendants would like
239=     to mark Exhibit 103 for identification.
240=                              (The above-referred to
241=                              document was thereupon
242=                              marked Defendant Exhibit
243=                              No. 103, and is attached
244=                              hereto.)
245=          MR. RIEGER:  And let's go ahead and do 104
246=     then if they are going to come in for
247=     identification.
248=                              (The above-referred to
249=                              document was thereupon
250=                              marked Defendant Exhibit
251=                              No. 104, and is attached
252=                              hereto.)
253=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Go ahead.
254=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) Mr. Himes, are you
255=familiar with Exhibit 104?
256=     A    I am.
257=     Q    And what is it?
258=     A    Again, it's a breakdown of the 2022 county
259=population.  It's the census population of counties
260=that are either single district counties on their
261=own or multidistrict counties, like an example
262=Davidson, a multidistrict, all within its boundary
fmt=pb
263=ten districts, and the counties that are kept whole
264=in Chapter 598.
265=     Q    So none of the counties in this list are
266=split?
267=     A    They are not.
268=     Q    What's the significance of the orange in
269=the population column?
270=     A    The orange are all expressing that they
271=are all underpopulated.  They don't have enough
272=population for a full district.
273=     Q    And if we could move over to Exhibit 105
274=now.  Are you familiar with this document, Mr.
275=Himes?
276=     A    I am.
277=     Q    What is it?
278=     A    So it's labeled 2022 County Population
279=Split Counties.  Again, this population data is
280=based on the results from the 2020 census, and this
281=is a demonstration of the 30 counties that were
282=split in Chapter 598.  The yellow indicates too much
283=population, and the orange expresses that there's
284=too little population.
285=               So, for example, Sullivan County has
286=158,163.  It's too much for one.  Divide it in two,
287=79,081, so it's too much for two districts.  And
fmt=pb
288=then, divide by three, 52,721, it's too little for
289=three full districts.  So that's what this table
290=expresses.
291=     Q    How do you determine how to solve this
292=puzzle?
293=     A    How do you determine just to solve the
294=puzzle in general?
295=     Q    Yes.
296=     A    As I mentioned yesterday, once the census
297=data comes in, I'm able to distill at least the
298=county populations from it.  And I'm able to see
299=which one of these may be stop signs, which ones are
300=whole district counties.  And that's the first step,
301=is just to understand that.  Then, sometimes on
302=geography, sometimes because of other requirements
303=like the Voting Rights Act, you have to take a look
304=at those areas, as well, to see how the puzzle will
305=fit.
306=               I think as we have mentioned -- I
307=don't want to get ahead of myself.  But 598 is based
308=on the concept that then once I have the information
309=the census put into our Maptitude software, I am
310=able to go down to the block level and see the
311=demographics and that helps voting rights
312=compliance.  It also helps me to build a concept.
fmt=pb
313=               So, when that's there, I'll take that
314=data in there, and I'll begin work on a single
315=concept to see if a plan can be put together based
316=on all the criteria.  Equal population being the
317=priority, but see if there's a way to make it work
318=and balance the factors that we talked about
319=yesterday, the eight factors that the house has used
320=as their criteria.
321=               And at that point, the direction I
322=need, as we talked about on Monday, would be --
323=because it becomes evident looking at that, that
324=districts have to move based on the population
325=shifts, the 30 counties that actually lost
326=population.  And looking at it from that higher
327=level, you can see that there is essentially a
328=three-seat shift from the sides East and West
329=Tennessee towards Middle Tennessee, and that's part
330=of the puzzle.
331=               What that means is, is that in those
332=85 counties that could be split, that three
333=districts that are currently there are going to have
334=to be eliminated.  I'll say with a proviso, but for
335=Shelby County that's the case.  Shelby County
336=presented the idea of whether you draw 13 or 14, and
337=of course that affects whether I need to have two or
fmt=pb
338=three districts in those other 85.
339=               So I need a little guidance at that
340=point.  I need guidance on where on Shelby County
341=should I start 13 or 14 districts.  As I said, 13
342=districts is closer to the ideal than 14 districts.
343=So one district is going to contract in Shelby
344=County.  And then, I need guidance on the more rural
345=areas of the state and where the districts would be
346=contracted.
347=               And Chapter 598 and sort of
348=originally in East Tennessee that occurs somewhere
349=around the Hamblen County area.  That's where a
350=district comes out.  And in middle, West Tennessee
351=it sort of naturally occurs to some extent because
352=of the expansion of population in Montgomery County.
353=And the push from the Mississippi River to Middle
354=Tennessee, District 75 came out of that part of the
355=state.
356=               So, if I have those parameters, then
357=I can start putting the puzzle piece together.
358=Again, knowing that where the districts are going to
359=be contracted and based on population, I can start
360=drawing.  A lot of ways from East Tennessee because
361=of the geographic puzzle and the census puzzle, but
362=then also at the same time from West Tennessee to
fmt=pb
363=make sure we are in compliance with the Voting
364=Rights Act.  So it's a puzzle that most of the time
365=ends in Middle Tennessee.
366=     Q    All right.  Using demonstratives 103, 104,
367=and 105, just flipping back and forth, do you have a
368=map in front of you that says Chapter 598?
369=     A    I do.
370=     Q    I'd like to talk about each of the county
371=splits.  Let's go alphabetically.  Could you explain
372=the split of Anderson County for us?
373=          MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, I would like to
374=     lodge an objection to any line of questioning
375=     that asks Doug Himes as the fact witness to
376=     state the reasons why any of the actual
377=     counties were divided, because Plaintiffs
378=     vigorously sought discovery on the why behind
379=     this map and were vigorously prevented from
380=     having that including with the sustained
381=     granted Motion in Limine the map.
382=          So, to the extent that Mr. Himes is going
383=     to point out that it could be whole or not
384=     whole, that's, of course, fine.  But he
385=     shouldn't be permitted at this point under the
386=     400 series of the Rules of Evidence to testify
387=     to the why behind any specific county split
fmt=pb
388=     when the Plaintiffs have been entirely shielded
389=     from any discovery about that why.
390=          Showing an example of that, you know, pick
391=     some random county, Hamblen County.  He may
392=     have a numbers why to tell you today, but we
393=     have no way of knowing and he has to shield
394=     from the Court whether or not the member from
395=     Hamblen or the Speaker himself communicated a
396=     priority about we need to split Hamblen.
397=          We heard on Monday the question of if a
398=     member asked you to split a county or put a
399=     county back together, can you tell us that?
400=     And that's held behind evidence.  So, there's
401=     no way for his testimony to be verifiably
402=     truthful when there's no discovery behind the
403=     actual why of any of the splits.  There's no
404=     examination of drafts leading to the splits to
405=     show how we got there.  If County was split in
406=     one draft and then not split later, the entire
407=     subjective why behind any split has been
408=     shielded from discovery in this case.
409=          And it may be that Mr. Rieger is going to
410=     tell me that's not what he's asking.  It's just
411=     a theoretical why based on purely population,
412=     which we are fine.  But to the extent there's
fmt=pb
413=     any questions asked about what was the actual
414=     reason justifying this county, that has been
415=     shielded from Plaintiffs in this case.
416=          And the ability to impeach has been
417=     prevented from being given to the Plaintiffs
418=     through the lack of the communications from the
419=     members and the evolution of the map through
420=     drafts and sub drafts.
421=          So to the extent that's what this question
422=     is or future questions are, we object to those
423=     questions being allowed for those reasons.
424=          MR. RIEGER:  Mr. Himes testified during
425=     his examination by Plaintiffs' counsel that he
426=     was the map drawer.  Now, during Mr. Himes'
427=     fact deposition, he was never asked to go
428=     through the counties and explain.  Instead,
429=     what Plaintiffs tried to get at were draft
430=     maps, or communications with members of the
431=     General Assembly.  They never took him down the
432=     path of pointing at a district and saying, why,
433=     why mathematically?  How do the numbers work on
434=     this?  They have not done so.  They did not
435=     attempt to do so.
436=          And to the extent that they had asked that
437=     question at deposition, we would have let that
fmt=pb
438=     occur.  Because, again, Doug Himes explaining
439=     why the numbers work for, as an example,
440=     Anderson County split would certainly not be
441=     covered by privilege.  The demographic numbers
442=     are what they are.  The census population is
443=     what it is.  The split is where it is on the
444=     map.
445=          Plaintiffs, again, did not ask this
446=     question during his fact deposition, and so
447=     it's fair game for Mr. Himes as a mapmaker to
448=     testify why Anderson County is split here.
449=          CHIEF JUDGE:  This would be difficult for
450=     the Court, and let me explain why and maybe
451=     this can be resolved in a way to make sure that
452=     everybody gets their shot at this.  The reason
453=     why I'm concerned about it is, one, a lot of
454=     information was excluded.  There was no in
455=     camera inspection so we don't know what it was.
456=     Secondly, the witness just testified that at
457=     some point he needs guidance.  We don't know
458=     what that is right now.  We don't know if
459=     something is going to be blurted out that in
460=     fairness should have been disclosed in
461=     discovery if it's going to be heard by the
462=     Panel.
fmt=pb
463=          So, I'm just a little concerned about
464=     this.  The Panel wants to draw the line at the
465=     right spot.  So I will ask the lawyers to
466=     address these comments.  You may end up
467=     repeating what you just said.  That's fine.
468=     Starting with counsel for Plaintiff.
469=          MR. TIFT:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think
470=     Mr. Rieger points to exactly the fundamental
471=     issue here.  You know, what we did ask
472=     Mr. Himes both in court on Monday is, did any
473=     member ask you to divide a county that you had
474=     not in your concept map divided?  Did any
475=     member ask you to reunite a county that you had
476=     in your draft map -- where he explained he was
477=     trying to meet all the criteria -- you had
478=     maybe not split it, you put it back together?
479=     And it's a hard stop on that kind of
480=     information.  We cannot know that.
481=          So, without having been able to probe the
482=     full reasoning behind it, when he has readily
483=     admitted, not only today but on Monday, that
484=     before he drafted his concept map, he got
485=     feedback from members on their priorities and
486=     to the best of his ability incorporated their
487=     priorities in addition to the eight factors he
fmt=pb
488=     was trying to reach.
489=          And that then, through the two-month
490=     drafting process that led to draft maps, sub
491=     drafts of maps that are still on his Maptitude
492=     today indicating a fulsome drafting process, he
493=     took further priorities from members and
494=     continued to try to incorporate them as he
495=     could do so.
496=          And as I believe Mr. Himes has already
497=     testified, for instance, every county in this
498=     left column could be whole or could be split.
499=     They are all under the 66,378 number.  So these
500=     are a lot of counties that there was a choice
501=     whether to split it or not.  It's a choice that
502=     in part is based on a 99-piece puzzle and that
503=     he has admitted is also informed by the
504=     priorities communicated to his members,
505=     including, he said, he got feedback from all
506=     the way to the Speaker of the house staff about
507=     their priorities.
508=          And, of course, we understand that
509=     Mr. Himes is the mapmaker.  In fact, part of
510=     our motion, which we supported with authority
511=     from other states this situation, that when a
512=     lawyer is wearing a non lawyer hat and doing a
fmt=pb
513=     fact process, that's not covered by the
514=     privilege that is on the privilege process.
515=          And we respect the Court's Ruling.  But as
516=     a result, non lawyer mapmaker Mr. Himes was
517=     prevented from testifying about how he drew the
518=     maps and the priorities that were incorporated
519=     into it.  So there's no way for him to in
520=     fairness testify about whether Carter County
521=     was split or had to be split when he has to
522=     shield off in his head whether or not the
523=     Speaker or the member from Carter County asked
524=     him to split it or asked him not to split it.
525=          Maybe it was to preserve a core.  Maybe
526=     the Speaker or some other person had one of two
527=     people to be able to run for that county.
528=     There's no way for him to testify about the
529=     reason and wall off his subjective knowledge of
530=     other reasons, while at the same time, we have
531=     literally no opportunity to point out the
532=     inaccuracy of his reason by showing the email
533=     from the member from Carter asking him to split
534=     the county or asking him to put the county back
535=     together.
536=          They have simply set up a situation where
537=     the why is unknowable in this court in a
fmt=pb
538=     fulsome way.  The only why he is trying to
539=     testify to is from a numerical way and
540=     shielding off a meaningful part of his actual
541=     knowledge, which he agrees he can't forget.  I
542=     don't know if I asked him that, but he said in
543=     his deposition he can't forget what a member
544=     told him.  So he has all the subjective
545=     knowledge.
546=          Maybe counsel do.  Maybe he has talked to
547=     the them about it.  Who doesn't is Plaintiffs
548=     and the Court.  So I don't see how Mr. Himes
549=     can testify to the actual why.  He can
550=     certainly show the breakpoints and that they
551=     could have been or couldn't have been.  But to
552=     testify as fact as the map drawer to the why is
553=     no longer possible through shielding his entire
554=     subjective experience of why.
555=          CHIEF JUDGE:  I'll hear from you but this
556=     is a matter that I'm going to have to confer
557=     with the Panel about.  It's important enough
558=     that I not try to blurt out something without
559=     consulting with them.  So we will hear your
560=     argument and take a recess to talk about this.
561=          MR. RIEGER:  Certainly, Your Honor, and
562=     I'll be brief because I'm afraid I might be
fmt=pb
563=     repetitive here.
564=          But the question of whether or not for
565=     each of these districts and each of these
566=     county splits the math checks out and that we
567=     are talking about counties that don't make
568=     sense by themselves, can't be split evenly or
569=     divided evenly, or put together with another
570=     county to meet that 5.09 high deviation or 4.91
571=     negative deviation is what we are trying to get
572=     at here.
573=          Again, we are not interested in going into
574=     things that are privileged or communications
575=     that are privileged.  We are interested in
576=     explaining to the Court through Mr. Himes and
577=     through the numbers a raw exercise of math as
578=     to why these districts work and why
579=     alternatives might not be and how each district
580=     shift mathematically causes changes in other
581=     ones, as well.  We are interested in going
582=     through on a mathematical basis an analysis of
583=     why these districts work.
584=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.  We'll take a
585=     recess.
586=                    [9:26 A.M., a recess was had
587=                    until 9:53 A.M.]
588=
fmt=pb
589=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Based on the question and
590=     the answer and the anticipated line of
591=     questioning, the Court sustains the objection.
592=     The Court relies on its prior ruling.  And I'll
593=     read two paragraphs near the end of that order:
594=          It says, "Therefore, the Panel finds that
595=     the thoughts, impressions, and reasoning
596=     employed by Attorneys Himes and Ryder in
597=     recommending certain maps in considering and
598=     declining to recommend other maps, including
599=     draft options initially created and
600=     subsequently abandoned, as well as the maps,
601=     data, documents, and materials created in
602=     forming these thoughts, impressions, and
603=     reasoning are covered by the attorney-client
604=     privilege and work product and therefore not
605=     discoverable.
606=          Likewise, the communications between the
607=     members of the General Assembly and Attorneys
608=     Himes and Ryder, which both generated and
609=     responded to those thoughts, impressions, and
610=     reasoning, including any of the maps, data,
611=     documents, and materials exchanged within those
612=     communications are also covered by the
613=     attorney-client privilege and work product and
fmt=pb
614=     therefore not discomfortable."
615=          As an additional point related to this
616=     ruling, the Panel cannot see how you could go
617=     district by district without violating the
618=     expressed terms of our prior order.
619=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, does that mean
620=     that we will not be able to have Mr. Himes
621=     explain why the math works for an individual
622=     district just purely using the population
623=     numbers and not going into the why or into
624=     anything that would have been shielded from
625=     discovery by the privilege?
626=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Counsel?
627=          MR. TIFT:  If it's a theoretical matter,
628=     Mr. Himes is talking about the math before him,
629=     you know, we think this points to the exact
630=     problem with having the fact witness be
631=     defended by an expert witness who is the same
632=     person.  But his opinions about the map on a
633=     theoretical basis, I think would be expert
634=     opinions and not fact opinions.  So in his
635=     capacity as expert, I think he could say how
636=     the map could work.
637=          He has also testified as the expert that
638=     the map itself, on its face, does not
fmt=pb
639=     demonstrate whether or not fewer than 30
640=     counties can be split, so I think there's a
641=     limitation.  But as an expert if he wants to
642=     talk theoretically about whether or not a
643=     county could have been split, though he did not
644=     do so in his expert report, other than to state
645=     specific reasons, including seven counties not
646=     for federal reasons, as an expert, if he wants
647=     to talk through theoretical math, we would
648=     allow that.
649=          But as a fact witness, we don't see how he
650=     could talk through -- I guess, if he's talking
651=     through theoretical math and not saying that's
652=     why it happened.  I mean, I guess we have to
653=     see how the questioning goes.
654=          In general, I think what's being asked is
655=     not for him to opine as an expert, not state
656=     facts as a fact witness.  So, we would say as a
657=     fact witness, the answer is no.  Fact witnesses
658=     are not supposed to give their opinions on a
659=     topic.  So, he is also an expert defending the
660=     map he created for his day job.  And if he
661=     wants to as an expert talk about math and
662=     theory, he can do that and we can cross examine
663=     him.
fmt=pb
664=          CHIEF JUDGE:  All right.  We don't know
665=     what the questions are going to be, so we don't
666=     want to necessarily preadmit questions.  Also,
667=     those questions and potential answers may end
668=     up as part of a proffer.  I don't know.
669=          But that's the guidance we have given you
670=     based on our ability from where we sit, not
671=     having seen a lot of these documents, not
672=     knowing what the questions are going to be, not
673=     knowing if they are going to be necessarily in
674=     the fact part of his hat or the expert part of
675=     his hat, but it's hard to imagine how going
676=     county by county we're not going to run afoul
677=     of the Court's order.  So, that's where we are.
678=          And so, you can continue on.  We'll have
679=     objections.  We'll do our best.  And if
680=     something gets an area where I think in
681=     fairness I need to talk with the other judges,
682=     we'll do that.
683=          MR. RIEGER:  Yes, Your Honor.  We'll give
684=     it a shot.
685=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) Mr. Himes, as an expert on
686=the large map, we'll go alphabetically, District 41
687=is Anderson County.  Can you explain the map of the
688=counties in those districts?
fmt=pb
689=          MR. TIFT:  Could I ask a clarification?
690=     For those of us that aren't familiar with the
691=     geographic location of all 99, whenever he
692=     talks about one, could he point us where it is
693=     on the map?
694=          MR. RIEGER:  Certainly, District 41 is
695=     just west of Knoxville.
696=          MR. TIFT:  And, Your Honor, I'm going to
697=     object for a second, that without laying a
698=     foundation that Mr. Himes in his expert
699=     capacity went through and analyzed the
700=     district-by-district populations, I think we
701=     need to set the foundation that he even knows
702=     that outside of his fact role as the person who
703=     drew the map.  There's no data in front of us
704=     about exactly all four of the counties in here
705=     I don't believe.  And I would like to have a
706=     foundation laid where he's coming from on that.
707=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, the census data
708=     has already been admitted into evidence
709=     regarding the population of each of the four
710=     counties in 41.
711=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.  Proceed with your
712=     question.
713=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) Mr. Himes, can you explain
fmt=pb
714=District 41, which includes Overton, Fentress,
715=Morgan, and Anderson Counties?
716=     A    I will just say before we start, I'm a
717=little unclear exactly what I am to say or not say.
718=     Q    Let me ask some more pointed questions
719=then.  Of Overton, Fentress, Morgan, and Anderson
720=Counties, can any of them be kept whole by
721=themselves?
722=     A    So, just looking at Chapter 598, Morgan
723=and Overton are kept whole in Chapter 598.  Fentress
724=has a population that's insufficient for one
725=district by itself, but it could be kept whole in
726=combination with others.  Anderson has too much
727=population for one district, and it needs to have a
728=portion of it attached to a different district.
729=     Q    And if we could move to Bradley County,
730=which is in the south of Tennessee adjoining Polk.
731=     A    And I would say for clarification, in my
732=expert report there is a footnote that beyond
733=population equality, which is the goal statewide,
734=lists possible reasons for why these counties are
735=split.  It goes through the 30 that are split and
736=lists that in a footnote.  So, that's there.
737=     Q    That's fine.  If we could go to Exhibit
738=14, please.  And if we could move to Page 38 and the
fmt=pb
739=footnote on that page.
740=     A    So, I'm there.
741=     Q    Okay.  And maybe this is the better way to
742=guide this approach.  So, for Anderson County,
743=that's listed there as population; is that accurate?
744=     A    That's correct.  And what I meant by
745=population, obviously, all 30 of these are
746=population equality.  You want to have a plan that
747=fits within your 10 percent.  But for the purpose of
748=this footnote that was done for the purpose of the
749=expert report, was not done prior to or during the
750=process of redistricting, but after just for this
751=report.  I used the term population to identify
752=those counties that had too much population to be
753=one district, so they have to be divided.  You can't
754=keep it together.
755=               So Anderson County, that's one of
756=those ones where there's too much for a single
757=district, too little for two districts, so it must
758=be divided and attached somewhere.  In this plan, it
759=attaches to 41.
760=               Fentress, on the other hand in the
761=footnote, which is alphabetical, is identified as
762=core preservation.  And for the purpose of this to
763=make the populations balanced between 41 and 38,
fmt=pb
764=District 38 is the exact same district as was
765=adopted in the 2012 redistricting round.  It's
766=population grew in a way that it could be left
767=alone.  And it included the Fentress County split
768=exactly as you see it.
769=               If you weren't to split that, you
770=would attach somebody else or another county would
771=have to be split.  But this keeps 38 in existing
772=boundary and keeps that Fentress County line the
773=same.  Core preservation, it's keeping that
774=convenience to the voters and the county election
775=folks.  They know what that line is already.  And
776=under one person, one vote as it applies to state
777=legislative districts, core preservation is a
778=legitimate factor in justifying a deviation.
779=     Q    Would you characterize core preservation
780=as a tool that helps determine what counties should
781=be split in furtherance of one person, one vote?
782=     A    Core preservation is a tool.  It's one of
783=the practices.  We have the six factors that are
784=listed in 3-1-103.  And the house, since I have
785=worked with the house in redistricting, has relied
786=on two practices, as well.  And together, those
787=eight things are the criteria that are envisioned by
788=the Constitution.  But the practice is core
fmt=pb
789=preservation and minimizing incumbent pairing.
790=               I think that the core preservation is
791=a useful tool that when you know you are in a
792=situation where you are going to split, to make it
793=as easy as possible on citizens, on election
794=officials in the county, and on the incumbents, that
795=that line is maintained.  And it varies from census
796=to census whether you can do that.
797=               In some cores you don't want to
798=preserve.  If you look at the District 80 in the
799=2000 round, that's something that you wouldn't want
800=to preserve what that looked like.  If you look at
801=District 92 in the 2012 round, you probably wouldn't
802=want to let that core continue.  Many times those
803=are just products of excess population.  You wind up
804=with a district that doesn't look so great.  And if
805=there's an opportunity to undue that or make it
806=better, that always would be a preference.
807=     Q    Is core preservation, as you referenced in
808=here, intertwined with one person, one vote?
809=     A    I believe it is.  I believe that the
810=United States Supreme Court has suggested that it is
811=a factor that justifies a deviation above an exact
812=ideal.  And I think some of that case law is
813=reflected in this expert report.
fmt=pb
814=     Q    Is it fair to say that of the 85 counties
815=that we discussed that can't form their own district
816=or districts by themselves, that core preservation
817=helps you assign what districts to put together and
818=what shapes to use in furtherance of one person, one
819=vote?
820=     A    Certainly.
821=     Q    All right.  We'll stay with your expert
822=report and the map, rather than the population data
823=for now, and just go down the line.  So Bradley
824=County is next.  Can you explain what you mean in
825=footnote 12 of your expert report?
826=     A    So Bradley County in southeast Tennessee
827=is a county that is identified in my expert report
828=as both population and core preservation.  District
829=24 and 22, so Bradley has enough population for one
830=full district and has excess population that needs
831=to exit the county boundary.  It has to in order to
832=comply with one person, one vote.
833=               So in doing that, again, it just
834=happens that we're starting with alphabetically, but
835=Districts 24, which is wholly within Bradley and
836=District 22, which comes outside of Bradley and
837=attaches to Polk and Meigs is the exact same
838=district lines that were drawn in 2012.
fmt=pb
839=               In that corner of the state, there's
840=actually -- and we'll get to the other counties.
841=But in that corner of the state, there's an eight
842=county area that if you go back to 2000
843=redistricting, most of those counties are in a very
844=similar formation with only minor adjustments.  So
845=as we go through this exercise, you'll see core
846=preservation a lot when we go up into Monroe and
847=Loudon.
848=     Q    If we could move on to Carroll County in
849=your footnote, and could you talk about what you
850=meant there?
851=     A    So, Carroll is identified in the footnote
852=as core preservation.  And it's, again, going
853=district by district and doing it this way, Carroll
854=County is, of course, in West Tennessee just
855=northeast of Madison County.  And looking at it this
856=way is a little bit different, because obviously
857=it's all a puzzle that works together to create the
858=whole plan.  But in this case, Carroll has not
859=enough population for a full district but could be
860=kept whole and attached in another idea with other
861=counties.
862=               But it's also one of those counties
863=around Gibson and in West Tennessee that lost a
fmt=pb
864=tremendous population shift and lost.  As I
865=mentioned yesterday, two-thirds of the counties in
866=West Tennessee actually had an actual loss.  Every
867=county around Gibson County, but for Madison, had a
868=loss.  And Madison, there's other factors in play
869=including the Voting Rights Act.
870=               So when it comes to Carroll, it was
871=split in the 2012 plan.  And in working these
872=districts together, it's split again.  But the line
873=is identified for core preservation, because the
874=population for this plan had to be attached to 76.
875=And rather than get a new segment of Carroll County,
876=you can maintain that line, which again makes it a
877=lot easier for the county election folks and for the
878=voters to know which district they are in.
879=     Q    Moving on to Carter, which is around the
880=Tri-cities, could you explain your footnote there?
881=     A    So for Carter County, I have listed
882=multiple things:  Population shift, core
883=preservation, and county splitting.  I'll explain
884=what I was meaning by these terms.  Core
885=preservation we have talked about.
886=               Population shift was when I analyzed
887=this for the expert report, was trying to focus on
888=that movement from east to west.  And I tried to use
fmt=pb
889=it sparingly, the descriptive term population shift,
890=because everything is shifting.  The whole map is
891=shifting.  But as I spoke about yesterday, there's
892=some dramatic shifting in that northeast corner
893=caused by counties that are losing population, and
894=you wind up in that corner with an extra half a
895=district of population.
896=               Carter County was split in 2012
897=redistricting and it's not a completely dissimilar
898=split.  It is different than this split.  But its
899=core of that district, District 4, is sill part of
900=it.  But because of Unicoi's population, which is
901=kept whole, and because of the fact that Washington
902=County and Greene County are whole districts.
903=Greene County is a single district county and
904=Washington is a two district county.  Carter has to
905=be split in some form.  Unicoi is too small to have
906=its own representative, so it needs to be attached.
907=               And this footnote identifies that the
908=reasons or the potential reasons are not only this
909=shift of population forcing the population in that
910=corner and as we talked about through Sullivan
911=County.  But also, it's a necessity at that point to
912=split Carter, because it's the only way to solve the
913=puzzle.
fmt=pb
914=               I guess you could also split Johnson,
915=but I don't know why you would do that.  You don't
916=have to split just Carter.  You can split an
917=additional county.  Obviously, that is not something
918=you would want to do.
919=     Q    I'm going to skip around a little bit here
920=if that's all right.  We'll go back to the ones we
921=are skipping over.  Can you take a look at Gibson?
922=     A    Certainly.
923=     Q    And what did you mean when you referenced
924=Gibson County in your footnote?
925=     A    So for Gibson County, I have population
926=shift and core preservation.  And as I just talked
927=about, if you look in the presentation, and I think
928=we talked about that yesterday, the original
929=presentation that I gave to the select committee on
930=redistricting in September of 2021, there's a map
931=that shows the counties that actually lost
932=population.  And if you look at that map, every
933=county that surrounds Gibson County that neighbors
934=it, but for Madison, actually lost population, which
935=is forcing the districts to Middle Tennessee.
936=               So, you are left with the problem
937=that there has to be splits in West Tennessee.  And
938=Madison County isn't an option to avoid that,
fmt=pb
939=because it has a full district and also because of
940=the Voting Rights Act means that the district that
941=is leaving Madison can't go towards Gibson.  It has
942=to go a different direction.
943=               So Gibson I have identified as being
944=split because of that population shift and also core
945=preservation, which I guess would seem interesting
946=in the sense that, well, you split it and it was
947=whole before.  Well, someone has to be split.  But
948=the population of that split leaves the majority of
949=District 79, which was the district that was in 2012
950=included all of Gibson and that same part of
951=Carroll.  The number of people in Gibson County is
952=the biggest of those three counties, of Gibson,
953=Carroll, and Henderson.  So it maintains the larger
954=part of Gibson.  It also draws it on Highway 45
955=West.  It tries to keep the municipalities all in
956=District 79.  Only Humboldt is split in Gibson
957=County.
958=               And then, 79 also is able to benefit
959=from the Carroll County preservation of that core
960=also that that line stayed the same.  So when I
961=described the core preservation, it's looking at
962=Gibson as the bigger piece of that three county
963=district now.  And also its core of the old 79 is
fmt=pb
964=still the essence of it.
965=     Q    If we could move to Claiborne in northeast
966=Tennessee?
967=     A    Sure.  Claiborne County is a product of
968=that geographical puzzle in the northeast corner,
969=but Claiborne is described for population shift and
970=district contraction and county splitting.  And what
971=I mean by district contraction is Claiborne is in a
972=location where the General Assembly chose to take a
973=district away from the map.  And part of that reason
974=is that half a district loss of population in that
975=northeast corner has to push its way through Hawkins
976=and continue towards Middle Tennessee.
977=               In that area of the state is where
978=that contraction was going to organically occur.
979=Claiborne then winds up being split because the
980=Hawkins remaining population and the Hancock total
981=county population isn't enough for a district.  So
982=Claiborne is split to add to District 9.
983=     Q    I would like to do three at once for the
984=next round, if that's okay.
985=     A    Yeah.
986=     Q    Could you discuss Haywood, Madison, and
987=Hardeman in West Tennessee?
988=     A    So Haywood, Madison, Hardeman Counties
fmt=pb
989=and I think it winds up being four legislative
990=districts:  It's Districts 81, 73, 94, and 80.  So,
991=for Hardeman County identified the Voting Rights Act
992=and core preservation.  For Haywood County, the
993=Voting Rights Act, population shift, and core
994=preservation.  And for Madison County, population,
995=Voting Rights Act, and core preservation.
996=               So there's a lot there.  And the only
997=new term that I use for describing these for this
998=expert report is the Voting Rights Act.  And as we
999=have talked about during the '90 round of
1000=redistricting, the General Assembly produced
1001=multiple house redistricting plans.  That resulted
1002=in litigation the Rural West line of cases in
1003=Federal Court.
1004=               The end result of that, even though
1005=it took a complete decade to work its way through
1006=the court, was essentially two plans.  There was an
1007=A and a B.  Plan A stayed in effect.  It didn't
1008=include a rural West Tennessee majority-minority
1009=district.  It stayed in effect until the 2000
1010=election when the Courts resolved that, no, there
1011=needs to be a rural West majority-minority district.
1012=And the General Assembly actually drew it in Plan B
1013=and it was there.  But it took to the 2000 round.
fmt=pb
1014=               That district included part of
1015=Haywood, part of Madison, and all of Hardeman
1016=County.  So it was that three county group of
1017=population that created that majority-minority
1018=district.
1019=               Here it's re-created in a way.  So
1020=Hardeman, again, I identified as possible voting
1021=rights, core preservation, and it does.  What it
1022=does is Hardeman's population is split to not only
1023=comply with the Voting Rights Act, it then maintains
1024=that same line at the southern end of the county.
1025=That's the exact same line that was in place in
1026=2012.  That's the same split of the county.
1027=               Again, if it's going to be split,
1028=it's a convenience to the voters and election
1029=coordinators to know that line, they don't have to
1030=adjust anything.  That's the same split.
1031=               In Haywood County, it's identified as
1032=the Voting Rights Act, population shift, and core
1033=preservation.  So there, you have the voting rights
1034=component.  You also have just the general
1035=population loss of population, not only in Haywood,
1036=but in Hardeman and all of West Tennessee, but it
1037=also keeps a core.  A historic core not only for
1038=District 80, which is the Voting Rights Act, but
fmt=pb
1039=it's also a core of around the same time of a Tipton
1040=County and Haywood County combination that was drawn
1041=in the 2000 round of redistricting.  So it preserves
1042=that core.
1043=               And then finally, for Madison County
1044=identified as population, voting rights, and core
1045=preservation.  Madison County, as we talked about,
1046=it's one of those counties that has too much
1047=population for one district, too little for two.  So
1048=it has to be split, and one district needs to be
1049=within Madison County.  And 73 is the district that
1050=has been in Madison County wholly for some time.
1051=               And the line that's reflected on this
1052=map is very similar, except for a few little
1053=adjustments in downtown, to the line that was in the
1054=2012 map, which then also means that the line for
1055=District 80, which is the district that
1056=Representative Shaw represents, is very similar for
1057=the district that helps us satisfy the Voting Rights
1058=Act component.
1059=     Q    If I could draw your attention to -- just
1060=leaving the map, I want to focus on something you
1061=just said.  Going back to this, which I believe is
1062=105 --
1063=          MR. RIEGER:  Which if we could mark that
fmt=pb
1064=     identification, please.  I don't know if that
1065=     was done.
1066=          CHIEF JUDGE:  It was.
1067=          MR. RIEGER:  Thank you.
1068=                              (The above-referred to
1069=                              document was thereupon
1070=                              marked Defendant Exhibit
1071=                              No. 105, and is attached
1072=                              hereto.)
1073=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) So each of these counties
1074=in yellow, must they be split?
1075=     A    Yes.
1076=     Q    Why?
1077=     A    They have to be split because they have
1078=too much population for one district and in some
1079=cases too much for two districts and in one case too
1080=much for three districts.
1081=     Q    Okay.  Going back to the map, I would like
1082=to do another set just to move this along hopefully
1083=a little faster.  Could we talk about Maury,
1084=Lawrence, and Hardin, which are all connected in
1085=southern Tennessee by District 71?
1086=     A    Okay.  So they incorporate multiple
1087=legislative districts in those counties in southern,
1088=Middle Tennessee.  As I mentioned, that has been an
1089=area where the map sometimes gets put together at
1090=the end.
fmt=pb
1091=          MR. TIFT:  I would just like to clarify.
1092=     My understanding is Mr. Himes is currently
1093=     testifying as an expert about his expert
1094=     analysis as opposed to what he knows about the
1095=     redistricting process.  I'd ask that we stick
1096=     to that.
1097=          CHIEF JUDGE:  I think everybody is on that
1098=     page.
1099=          MR. RIEGER:  Yes.
1100=          THE WITNESS:  Sorry.
1101=          So for Hardin for the expert report, was
1102=     identified as core preservation.  For Lawrence,
1103=     it was identified as population shift and core
1104=     preservation.  And for Maury County, it's
1105=     population.
1106=               So I think probably the easiest one
1107=to start with is the Maury.  Maury County is one of
1108=those counties that has too much population for one
1109=district and too little population for two
1110=districts.  So one district, District 64 is created
1111=wholly within the county and the remaining
1112=population has to exit.
1113=               So Lawrence identifies population
1114=shift and core preservation.  So again, I would just
1115=explain the shifting of the losses of population
fmt=pb
1116=from west and east and the growth in middle, that's
1117=going to shift everything to the middle of the
1118=state.  And Lawrence County is one of the places
1119=where that shifting has occurred.
1120=               That said, the division in Lawrence
1121=between Districts 71 and District 70, is not
1122=entirely dissimilar to a split that was in the 2012.
1123=It's not as close as, say, the split in Sevier, but
1124=it is a split of a county that had been split in a
1125=previous between the same two districts.
1126=               And for Hardin County, it says core
1127=preservation.  And again, this is one and you look
1128=at it and you think, well, what is the core?  Well,
1129=District 71 before this redistricting was Hardin,
1130=Wayne, Lawrence, and Lewis.  But because of the
1131=population pressures, Lewis is no longer part of 71.
1132=Lawrence is slightly different.  Maury County's
1133=excess population had to go somewhere, and it was
1134=attached to District 71.  In order to keep some of
1135=that traditional 2012 core together, a portion of
1136=Hardin County is attached to District 71.
1137=               While it may look like an odder
1138=looking shape, I believe that's Highway 64 and
1139=Highway 203.  Just if you have to split, it's better
1140=to give some sort of boundary that people might know
fmt=pb
1141=what it is.
1142=     Q    And if I could draw your attention a
1143=little bit north to Dickson County.
1144=     A    So Dickson County, there's two districts
1145=that the split in Dickson County has within it.
1146=It's District 69 and District 78.  And it's
1147=identified as core preservation and incumbents.  And
1148=it is the only time in this expert report in the
1149=footnote that incumbents is used.  And obviously, it
1150=means that there's two incumbents that reside in
1151=Dickson County, and there has been through the last
1152=cycle.
1153=               That said, the core of those
1154=districts is not dissimilar.  Dickson has been split
1155=between the two representatives.  One representative
1156=has had the smaller portion of Dickson County and
1157=all of Cheatham County.  And again, Cheatham is
1158=backed up with three counties that you can't divide:
1159=Robertson County, which is a single-member district
1160=county, it's perfect; Montgomery, that has the three
1161=districts within its boundary; and Davidson County,
1162=which has the ten districts within the borders of
1163=Davidson.
1164=               So, Cheatham has to go somewhere.
1165=And under Chapter 598 in order to keep it similar to
fmt=pb
1166=the 2012, it attaches to Dickson County and
1167=preserves that core for both districts to some
1168=extent.
1169=     Q    Hamblen County, please.
1170=     A    Hamblen County is identified as population
1171=shift and district contraction.  District
1172=contraction, again, the same as Claiborne, what we
1173=are missing in this part of northeast Tennessee --
1174=and this is part of the northeast Tennessee push of
1175=population out of the extreme northeast concern --
1176=is like Claiborne, there is a missing district.  And
1177=the district that's missing was Claiborne and
1178=Grainger and maybe part of Union.  My mind is
1179=getting a little bit fuzzy on that.  But it's moved.
1180=It's gone.  That district has moved to Middle
1181=Tennessee.
1182=               And Hamblen is split between
1183=Districts 10 and 11, and it is split.  And
1184=essentially, because Greene is a whole county and
1185=Cocke is below it and then Sevier.  Blount County is
1186=another whole county.  It's two districts.  Knox is
1187=a whole county.  So you've got population pressures,
1188=not only of that shifting population, but you also
1189=have Sevier and Cocke and Jefferson that you have to
1190=deal with.
fmt=pb
1191=               And coming east to west, Cocke would
1192=need more population.  It's not big enough for its
1193=own district.  Jefferson County is currently split
1194=in the 2012 plan.  And I have identified it here as
1195=population shift and core preservation.  And why
1196=this is important to talk about with Hamblen County
1197=is it's, again, part of the population shift.  But
1198=the Jefferson County line that you see in Chapter
1199=598 is exactly the same split of Jefferson County
1200=that exists today.
1201=               And then, it's within District 11
1202=today, but it's not enough population for District
1203=11; hence, the split of Hamblen County and the
1204=contraction of the district that was above it, which
1205=had part of Grainger.  Grainger is kept whole in
1206=this map and attached to it.
1207=     Q    And if we could stay in upper, East
1208=Tennessee and go to Hawkins, please.
1209=     A    So Hawkins County is identify as
1210=population shift and county splitting.  The
1211=population shift I talked about.  I think I talked
1212=about the county splitting when we were in Carter.
1213=There's no way to draw a map that I know of, any map
1214=that you can draw without splitting Hawkins, because
1215=of that population exiting that northeast corner.
fmt=pb
1216=And it is because of the stop signs of Greene and
1217=Washington, and this is part of that overall shift
1218=from that corner towards the middle of the state
1219=that's just unavoidable and it has to be split.
1220=     Q    And just to clarify, when you say "stop
1221=sign" what are you referring to?
1222=     A    And if there's a better term somebody has
1223=for it, I could say it.  It's the ten whole
1224=counties, either multidistricts all within the
1225=county boundary or single county districts, which
1226=there's only two of them in this cycle, which is
1227=Robertson and Greene, which the population is
1228=sufficient to be a single county.  So I just refer
1229=to those as stop signs.  You can't break those
1230=boundaries, but for if you have a really good
1231=reason, I would think.
1232=     Q    If we could go to middle, West Tennessee
1233=and go to Henderson right next to Madison?
1234=     A    So Henderson is identified in the expert
1235=report as population shift.  And this is just a
1236=result of the shifts further to the west moving
1237=east.  It's the population for again the map that's
1238=in part of that presentation of September 17th of
1239=all the counties in West Tennessee.  Two-thirds of
1240=them that have actual loss population.
fmt=pb
1241=               Redistricting sometimes is a domino
1242=effect.  And in order to draw 79 from the remainder
1243=of Gibson and Carroll, more population needed to be
1244=added.  And while you could go different directions,
1245=Chapter 598 goes through Henderson County.
1246=     Q    And if we could move north of that and
1247=talk about Henry.
1248=     A    So Henry County in sort of still extreme
1249=northeast of Madison County on the Tennessee River
1250=is identified in the expert report as population
1251=shift and district contraction.  The shifting is the
1252=same shifting.  It's the movement to Middle
1253=Tennessee of the West Tennessee districts.  But it's
1254=also, this is one of the places, like Hamblen County
1255=and the district in Shelby County, where there's a
1256=contraction, where a district is missing from the
1257=map.  And that district numbered was 75, but it was
1258=a district that included Henry County, Stewart, and
1259=Benton, if I'm not mistaken.
1260=               But because District 74 was a large
1261=portion of Montgomery County in the previous cycle
1262=and because Montgomery County had a very explosive
1263=growth and the boundary is three districts within
1264=it, it became an area of the state where contraction
1265=occurred.  And Henry County is added to the four
fmt=pb
1266=full counties of Stewart, Houston, Humphreys, and
1267=Benton to fit the population.
1268=     Q    And if we could move next to Jefferson,
1269=just east of Knox County.
1270=     A    Jefferson County, and I mentioned it I
1271=think a second ago.  I got ahead of myself.  But
1272=Jefferson is identified as population shift and core
1273=preservation.  So Jefferson County in the 2012 plan
1274=was District 17 and District 11, and that boundary
1275=for that division of Jefferson County is exactly the
1276=same in this plan as it was in the prior plan.
1277=               And again, you have to almost talk
1278=about Sevier County.  Sevier County below it has too
1279=much population for a single district, and its
1280=excess population has to go somewhere.  And in
1281=Chapter 598 it's possible to have the District 17
1282=that currently has essentially the same part of
1283=Sevier County attached to the part of Jefferson that
1284=it currently has.
1285=     Q    Thank you.  Since you referenced Sevier,
1286=let's go ahead and take care of that one.
1287=     A    Okay.  So Sevier County is population and
1288=core preservation.  It's too much population for two
1289=districts.  And that division is essentially very
1290=close to the same division of Sevier that exists and
fmt=pb
1291=it's sort of a core preservation.  Of the part that
1292=you have to get rid of, it's essentially the same
1293=part.
1294=     Q    Lincoln County, south of Nashville on the
1295=Alabama border.
1296=     A    Sure.  So Lincoln County is identified as
1297=population shift and core preservation.  In Chapter
1298=598, Lincoln County is between Districts 70 and 62.
1299=62 is a district that has both Bedford and Moore
1300=Counties whole.  And the line that District 52
1301=currently has with Lincoln County is very narrowly
1302=the same as the line that's on the map Chapter 598.
1303=So that helps with the core preservation of District
1304=62, which needs the population to be added to it
1305=with Bedford and Moore to make a full county.
1306=               And we talked about that shifting of
1307=population from east to middle and west to middle.
1308=Lincoln County's remaining population helps Giles
1309=and the remainder of Lawrence just with the
1310=population issue of making that district comply
1311=within the overall range.
1312=     Q    By overall range, are you talking about
1313=the 5.09 percent and negative 4.91 percent
1314=deviation?
1315=     A    That would be an absolute 10 percent.  But
fmt=pb
1316=I'm talking about the positive 5.09 to the negative
1317=4.91 which is in the plan.
1318=     Q    If you could move to Loudon County,
1319=please, which is southwest of Knox next to Blount.
1320=     A    So for Loudon County I believe is
1321=identified as core preservation.  And Monroe
1322=County -- I sort of have to talk about Monroe with
1323=it, which is also identified as core preservation.
1324=And as I mentioned when we were discussing Bradley
1325=County, the area that contains Meigs, Bradley, Polk,
1326=McMinn, Loudon and Roane County are essentially,
1327=with some minor variations, are the same or very
1328=similar districts with some differences of what part
1329=of the county small portions may be attached to
1330=going back to the 2000 cycle of redistricting.
1331=               Because Bradley, the Districts 24 and
1332=22 that include Bradley, Polk, and Meigs are exactly
1333=the same from 2012 and because they back up to
1334=Hamilton County, that leaves you with McMinn County
1335=or Monroe.  If you kept one whole, one would be
1336=split.  Monroe County is attached to full McMinn
1337=County for population reasons, but it maintains a
1338=core.  The boundary line that you see for Monroe
1339=County is very similar to the boundary line of the
1340=2012 plan.
fmt=pb
1341=               And then, because of that split, it's
1342=not enough population left for a district, and
1343=population from Loudon is added, which again creates
1344=a bit of a domino in that part of the state.  With
1345=that said, the line that's in Loudon County near
1346=Lenoir City is very similar to the line that's in
1347=the 2012 plan and historically goes back to a split
1348=of Loudon County in the 2000 plan.
1349=     Q    If I could draw your attention to Obion
1350=County in northwest Tennessee.
1351=     A    Yes.  So Obion is identified as population
1352=shift, and it is a result of the shifting of
1353=population and the loss of population in West
1354=Tennessee.  District 82 needed population and from
1355=Lauderdale and Crockett kept whole, Gibson is a
1356=bridge to make sure that enough population could be
1357=in the districts.  So, Obion helps District 82 with
1358=its population variance.
1359=     Q    And if I could get you to move to Putnam
1360=County please.
1361=     A    So District 42 and 25 is Putnam County.
1362=So Putnam County is identified as population shift
1363=and core preservation.  So Putnam County is one of
1364=those counties that has too much population for one
1365=district, too little for two districts, so it has to
fmt=pb
1366=be split.  It's currently split between Districts 42
1367=and 25.  I say currently.  It was split in the 2012
1368=round between Districts 42 and 25.
1369=               This map maintains that that split
1370=between those same two districts and I believe it's
1371=two voting precincts difference, so the core of it
1372=is not dissimilar.  District 42 had to give up a
1373=little bit of population.
1374=     Q    And if I could get you to move to the
1375=southeast to Roane County, please.
1376=     A    So Roane County is identified as core
1377=preservation.  Again, this is that same eight county
1378=area in southeast Tennessee that goes back to the
1379=2000 round, where it's just difficult to probably
1380=draw that area of the state in a different way.
1381=Roane's split has been on both ends.  Roane has been
1382=split on the south end and on the north end.  But
1383=essentially Roane is maintaining the core of
1384=District 32 and attached to that portion and Loudon
1385=that has part of Lenoir City.
1386=     Q    And if I could get you to move to Sullivan
1387=County in the Tri-city area.
1388=     A    And Sullivan County is identified here as
1389=population, county splitting.  So I think I probably
1390=talked more than anybody wants to hear about the
fmt=pb
1391=northeast Tennessee, but Sullivan has enough
1392=population for two whole districts but not enough
1393=for three whole districts.  It has to be split.
1394=It's too much population for three.  It has to go
1395=out.
1396=               It was compounded by the fact that we
1397=had this bubble of a half a district's population in
1398=Unicoi, Carter, and Johnson Counties.  You have the
1399=stop signs of Washington County and Greene County,
1400=and the population from Johnson and the remainder of
1401=Carter has to exit through Sullivan.  There's no
1402=other way to do it.  It is not a pretty looking
1403=district, but it's a district that has to be created
1404=to comply with the Constitution.
1405=     Q    And then, the last three:  Sumner County,
1406=Wilson County, and Williamson County, you have
1407=listed population for those.  Can you explain that
1408=briefly?
1409=     A    So all three of those counties have enough
1410=population in the case of Sumner for two full
1411=districts but not enough for three.  It has to be
1412=split.  Wilson has enough population for two full
1413=districts but has a little too much.  I think it
1414=would have made the variance a little too high
1415=beyond a 5.09, so some has to come out.
fmt=pb
1416=               And then Williamson County has enough
1417=population for three full districts and then has
1418=about a half a district even though it doesn't look
1419=like that much in Chapter 598, but that city of
1420=Spring Hill has a lot of population.  So that excess
1421=population is attached to Marshall County.
1422=     Q    Is core preservation a tool to decide how
1423=to solve one person, one vote?
1424=     A    Is core preservation a tool to decide?
1425=     Q    To solve one person, one vote.
1426=     A    It's a criteria of the house, and it is a
1427=justification for having a deviation.
1428=     Q    Does it help you to decide what counties
1429=to split to get in compliance with equal protection?
1430=     A    Knowing that a county will be split, it
1431=helps with hopefully making it more convenient to
1432=the people that are there and the people that
1433=administer elections in those areas where core
1434=preservation keeps the boundary exactly the same.
1435=And then, I think it helps knowing if you are having
1436=to split to balance these districts population wise
1437=of keeping some of the communities or historical
1438=districts together.
1439=     Q    I would like to draw your attention to the
1440=middle of Page 38 on your expert report.  Is the
fmt=pb
1441=enacted house map similar to the number of county
1442=splits in previous maps?
1443=     A    Yes.
1444=     Q    Please explain that for us.
1445=     A    Sure.  So going back to the past
1446=redistricting cycles, I've talked about the 90 round
1447=and the Plan A and Plan B.  There was a Plan C, too,
1448=but that one was, I think, pretty irrelevant early
1449=in the rounds.  But Plan A had 29 splits.  Plan B,
1450=which was the plan that included the Rural West
1451=Tennessee majority-minority district had 30 splits.
1452=In the 2002 round, there was no A and B.  There was
1453=just one plan, and Chapter 468 had 30 splits.  And
1454=in the 2012 round, Chapter 511 had 28 splits.
1455=     Q    And if I could get you to flip to Page 39,
1456=please, of your expert report.  In your Conclusion,
1457=you state:
1458=          "Specifically the singular focus on one
1459=     criteria in county splitting over other
1460=     legitimate criteria and the subsequent failure
1461=     to adhere to that criteria and by failing to
1462=     preserve districts and/or county lines in
1463=     Madison, Montgomery, and Shelby Counties,
1464=     greatly distorts the number of county splits
1465=     advanced in the alternative plans."
fmt=pb
1466=               Can you explain what you mean by
1467=that?
1468=     A    Yes, I certainly can.  So, I think, you
1469=know, that the focus is always on crafting a
1470=constitutional plan.  And I think I mentioned that I
1471=think you can have multiple constitutional plans
1472=that may have a difference in overall deviation, in
1473=the number of counties that are split, and have
1474=differences in the other eight criteria that the
1475=General Assembly uses, and they can all be
1476=constitutional.
1477=               But I think focusing on a single
1478=factor and then not doing it, not preserving a full
1479=district in Madison County, not replicating the
1480=General Assembly's choice the keeping three
1481=districts in Montgomery County and splitting a
1482=county that is a whole county that can be devisable
1483=either on its own as a district or can be divided,
1484=and splitting a county that doesn't need to be
1485=divided, I think can distort the number of splits
1486=that you can get to.
1487=     Q    Could you draw fewer splits if you were
1488=allowed to split urban counties?
1489=     A    I believe you probably could.
1490=     Q    Okay.  Are you permitted to double split a
fmt=pb
1491=county?
1492=     A    You are not permitted to double split a
1493=county.
1494=     Q    Why not?
1495=     A    I think that goes back to the whole
1496=purpose of trying to take one person, one vote and
1497=Article 2, Section 5 and meld them together.  That
1498=if there is a split of a county, that that county
1499=should be split in a way that is probably the
1500=easiest for the electorate, for the candidates, and
1501=the election folks to understand.  And double
1502=splitting does not help you conform those two
1503=principles.
1504=     Q    In your expert opinion, did the General
1505=Assembly make an honest and good-faith effort here?
1506=     A    It appears that looking at this plan and
1507=going through the counties as we just did, I think
1508=they have.
1509=          MR. RIEGER:  Okay.  And, Your Honor, I
1510=     would like to confer with counsel, but I think
1511=     we are about to move Mr. Himes' testimony into
1512=     some senate election results.  So, if the Court
1513=     would like to take a break, it might be a good
1514=     stopping point.
1515=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Let's take a ten-minute
fmt=pb
1516=     break.
1517=                    [10:55 A.M., a recess was had
1518=                    until 11:11 A.M.]
1519=
1520=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Just wanted to let the
1521=     lawyers know that we are hoping to take the
1522=     lunch break around 12:30, but we don't want to
1523=     interrupt anybody's flow of questioning.
1524=          MR. RIEGER:  I think we can make that work
1525=     with the end of the Direct, Your Honor.
1526=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) Mr. Himes, have you
1527=reviewed Cervas concept map 13b_e as part of Summary
1528=Judgment?
1529=     A    I believe I have.
1530=     Q    Okay.  Do you know whether or not that map
1531=unnecessarily split Madison County?
1532=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Could we go to the document,
1533=     please?  That would help me.
1534=          MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, if you want to see
1535=     a visual representation, if you would look at
1536=     Tab 8, b with the proviso that it no longer
1537=     contains noncontiguities.
1538=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) Exhibit 8, Page 14,
1539=please.
1540=     A    I'm there.
1541=     Q    And I believe you testified earlier that
fmt=pb
1542=there were noncontiguities in Cervas map 13b?
1543=     A    Yes.  I did an evaluation on 13b.
1544=     Q    If you removed the noncontiguities in 13b,
1545=would that map still unnecessarily split Madison
1546=County?
1547=     A    Yes.  Just looking at it I can tell you
1548=yes.
1549=     Q    If you'll turn the page to 14a.  If you
1550=removed the noncontiguities from 14a, would it still
1551=unnecessarily split Madison County?
1552=     A    Looking at the map on Page 15, yes, it
1553=would.
1554=     Q    Okay.  Turning two pages to 13.5a_e.  If
1555=you removed all the noncontiguities from 13.5a,
1556=would it still split Shelby County?
1557=     A    It would.
1558=     Q    Would it still reduce the number of
1559=majority-minority districts from 13 to 11?
1560=     A    I guess unless it had been corrected in
1561=the e version.
1562=     Q    Okay.  On the next page, moving to 13.5b,
1563=if you removed the noncontiguities from 13.5b, would
1564=it still split Shelby County?
1565=     A    Yes.
1566=     Q    Would it still unnecessarily split Madison
fmt=pb
1567=and Montgomery Counties?
1568=     A    I can look at this map and tell you, yes,
1569=it would for Madison.  The coloring on Montgomery --
1570=I would have done an evaluation of this somewhere.
1571=I can't see the coloring very well.
1572=     Q    But with the noncontiguities corrected,
1573=the maps would still be constitutionally deficient;
1574=is that accurate?
1575=     A    If there was a county that should have
1576=been a whole county that was split, fixing
1577=contiguity issues would not solve that.
1578=     Q    All right.  And if I could turn just
1579=generally to your time with the General Assembly.
1580=How long have you been with the General Assembly?
1581=     A    Since 1992 beginning as an intern.  As a
1582=part-time employee, one session in '94.  And then as
1583=a full-time employee, from '98 until June of 2018.
1584=And then, back by June of 2019 until today.
1585=     Q    If I could get you to take a look at
1586=Exhibits 36 through 40.
1587=          MR. TIFT:  And, Your Honor, we would like
1588=     to lodge an objection at this point for this
1589=     line of questioning.  Exhibits 36 through 40 --
1590=     and I would encourage Your Honor, you can go
1591=     ahead and look at 36 to see what I'm talking
fmt=pb
1592=     about -- are printouts of the journals of the
1593=     senate from various different years from their
1594=     organizational first day.
1595=          We stipulate to their authenticity.  They
1596=     seem to be journals.  But the problem is that
1597=     in this case, on the senate claim, as an expert
1598=     witness, Mr. Himes has expressly disclaimed
1599=     having any opinion on the senate claim.  On the
1600=     house testimony on Monday, he has testified to
1601=     having no interaction with the drawing of the
1602=     senate map.
1603=          And in response to Interrogatories, in
1604=     which Plaintiffs asked for Defendants to
1605=     identify which witnesses they would intend to
1606=     rely on for the senate claim, they responded
1607=     none at this time.  And there's never been a
1608=     time since then where they have revised this.
1609=     So, their expert Doug Himes doesn't have any
1610=     opinions on the senate.  Their fact witness
1611=     Doug Himes was proffered on the house side and
1612=     has never been proffered as someone on the
1613=     senate claim.
1614=          Now, the Courts can certainly take
1615=     judicial notice of -- I believe these are just
1616=     going to be used to show which senators were
fmt=pb
1617=     where when.  We don't mind admitting these for
1618=     the sake of Defense being able to cite them in
1619=     the post-trial brief on their senate claim.
1620=          But in terms of questioning Mr. Himes
1621=     about them, we don't see any reason why that
1622=     would be appropriate or a good use of Court's
1623=     time when it's mostly just supporting a
1624=     post-trial brief argument about the lack of
1625=     turnover.
1626=          So we would submit that it's objectionable
1627=     for this witness, who is not disclosed on the
1628=     senate on either his expert or house side, to
1629=     testify about them.  We don't object to them
1630=     being admitted into the record for citing to in
1631=     post-trial briefs.
1632=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, we have no intent
1633=     of asking the witnesses any questions about
1634=     these other than to authenticate.  So, if the
1635=     Plaintiffs are okay with allowing in the senate
1636=     journals in 36 through 40 and the Secretary of
1637=     state election results from 41 through 82, we
1638=     can end the examination with that, just by
1639=     putting them all into the record and letting us
1640=     do with them what we will on the post-trial
1641=     brief.
fmt=pb
1642=          MR. TIFT:  Plaintiffs don't object.
1643=     Substantively, we do and will argue they are
1644=     irrelevant to the Court's analysis, but we
1645=     don't dispute the Court can take judicial
1646=     notice of them, and they can argue in their
1647=     brief that they are relevant.  And it will be
1648=     convenient for the Court to have the copies.
1649=     So, no objection.
1650=          CHIEF JUDGE:  So correct me if I'm
1651=     incorrect on this, but Exhibits 36 through 82
1652=     are now being admitted without any objection to
1653=     authenticity.  And then, there will be legal
1654=     arguments about what they mean in the posttrial
1655=     brief.
1656=          MR. RIEGER:  Correct, Your Honor.  We just
1657=     want to establish the office holders.  We know
1658=     the Court can take judicial notice of it, but
1659=     we have gone ahead and gathered all the
1660=     information and that way it's in the record and
1661=     we can talk about it in our posttrial brief.
1662=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
1663=                              (The above-referred to
1664=                              document was thereupon

1676=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) Back for just briefly to
1677=the house, were any of the alternative maps that
1678=were presented to the General Assembly even remotely
1679=constitutional?
1680=     A    Presented to the General Assembly, no.
1681=The General Assembly did not have any of the four
1682=public maps that were submitted by the November 12th
1683=deadline, or the Democratic caucus' plan all had
1684=constitutional deficiencies.
1685=     Q    If I could draw your attention to Tab No.
1686=28, please.
1687=     A    I'm there, sir.
1688=     Q    Are you familiar with this document?
1689=     A    I am.
1690=     Q    What is it?
1691=     A    It's a map of the Chapter 511, which is
1692=the 2012 house plan, which is the plan that was
1693=drawn from the House of Representatives based on the
1694=2010 census.
1695=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, at this time, we
1696=     would move to introduce this as Exhibit No. 28,
fmt=pb
1697=     and we understand there's no objection.
1698=          MR. TIFT:  There's no objection.
1699=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibit 28 submitted with no
1700=     objection.
1701=                              (The above-referred to
1702=                              document was thereupon
1703=                              marked Defendant Exhibit
1704=                              No. 28, and is attached
1705=                              hereto.)
1706=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) And if I could draw your
1707=attention to the Tab right before it, No. 27.  Are
1708=you familiar with this document?
1709=     A    I am.
1710=     Q    What is it?
1711=     A    It's Chapter 568, which is the 2002 house
1712=plan, which was the plan for the House of
1713=Representatives drawn after the 2000 census.
1714=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, at this time, we
1715=     would like to move Exhibit No. 27 into
1716=     evidence.
1717=          MR. TIFT:  There's no objection.
1718=          CHIEF JUDGE:  For the record, the witness
1719=     said 568.  Is it 468 or 568?
1720=          THE WITNESS:  My apologies.  It's 468.
1721=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Great.  It's admitted into
1722=     evidence without objection.

1726=                              marked Defendant Exhibit
1727=                              No. 27, and is attached
1728=                              hereto.)
1729=     Q    (By Mr. Rieger) Earlier when you were
1730=discussing the concept of core preservation, were
1731=you referring to the districts that existed in 2012
1732=and 2002?
1733=     A    Yes.  Both 2002 and 2012 you can see some
1734=of the core preservation similarities.  And then, on
1735=occasion, I believe that I referred to Plan B for
1736=the District 80 components, which is the 1990
1737=redistricting.
1738=     Q    If I could draw your attention to Tab No.
1739=31, please.  Are you familiar with that document?
1740=     A    It appears to be the senate districts from
1741=the '98 General Assembly.
1742=     Q    Would that reflect the 1990's senate map?
1743=          MR. TIFT:  Again, Your Honors, we would
1744=     object.  I think this is already admitted
1745=     through Ms. Hunt's testimony, but to the extent
1746=     he is being asked to testify on the senate, he
1747=     is not a disclosed witness.
1748=          MR. RIEGER:  We're just moving it into
1749=     evidence, if it's not there already.
1750=          MR. TIFT:  It's there already.
fmt=pb
1751=          MR. RIEGER:  Okay.  Is 32 in, as well?
1752=          MR. TIFT:  I thought 31 and 32 came in on
1753=     Monday.
1754=          MR. RIEGER:  If that's the case, I will
1755=     pass the witness.
1756=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibits 31 and 32 are
1757=     either already admitted or are either now being
1758=     admitted without objection.
1759=          MR. RIEGER:  Thank you, your Honor.  I'll
1760=     pass the witness.
1761=                       - - -
1762=
1763=CROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. TIFT:
1764=     Q    All right.  Mr. Himes, you agree you have
1765=not provided an expert opinion concerning the
1766=enacted senate map from this last redistricting
1767=cycle, correct?
1768=     A    I agree.
1769=     Q    I would like to direct you back to the
1770=exhibit that's been marked for identification.  It's
1771=a demonstrative, Exhibit 105.
1772=     A    I'm there.
1773=     Q    You've got the multicolored four or five
1774=column chart?
1775=     A    Yes.
fmt=pb
1776=     Q    And earlier you testified that there's ten
1777=counties that can fully contain districts within
1778=them, and there's no reason to split the boundary,
1779=because they contain fully within them districts,
1780=correct?
1781=     A    That is correct.
1782=     Q    And then, there's a second bucket or
1783=category of counties represented in the third,
1784=fourth, and fifth rows here that can contain one,
1785=two, or three full districts and have to have a
1786=county line split for the balance of the population,
1787=correct?
1788=     A    Yes, there's a subset of those here.
1789=     Q    And then, the second column reflects a
1790=third category, which are all counties where the
1791=population is beneath the lowest acceptable
1792=population for one district, correct?
1793=     A    Are you saying the second column that's
1794=labeled population, the darker orange color?
1795=     Q    Good clarification.  The 20 dark orange
1796=counties in the population column all have
1797=populations less than one acceptable district?
1798=     A    Yeah, that's correct.
1799=     Q    And looking at any one of these counties
1800=in isolation, not looking at the county surrounding
fmt=pb
1801=it, there's no way as an expert to say whether they
1802=have to be divided or could be kept whole and paired
1803=with another county, correct?
1804=     A    That is correct.
1805=     Q    And looking specifically at Gibson County
1806=here, there's no way in isolation to say whether or
1807=not it has to be divided or can't be divided,
1808=correct?
1809=     A    That's correct.
1810=     Q    And typically, when you are looking at a
1811=redistricting map, looking at any single county in
1812=isolation can't demonstrate to you whether or not it
1813=has to be divided or can't be divided, correct?
1814=     A    Rephrase that, please.
1815=     Q    If you're just going to take a map of the
1816=state of Tennessee and look at all except those that
1817=the 85 counties that don't evenly break down, you're
1818=not going to be able to look at just that one county
1819=and say whether or not it has to be split or not?
1820=Actually, let me rephrase that.  I'm speaking about
1821=all the counties where their population is under one
1822=district.  You can't look at those and say in
1823=isolation whether or not they have to be divided or
1824=can't be divided?
1825=     A    That's right.  The ones that are below the
fmt=pb
1826=threshold of negative 4.91.
1827=     Q    And that subset of counties are inherently
1828=reliant upon other counties around them for you to
1829=figure out whether or not they do need to be split,
1830=correct?
1831=     A    I agree.  You have to look at the map as a
1832=whole.
1833=     Q    And you agree the 99-piece puzzle you
1834=referred to, there can be many different decisions
1835=for any given one of those counties depending on how
1836=the other puzzle pieces come together?
1837=     A    That is correct.
1838=     Q    And any one piece of that puzzle is
1839=inherently reliant on the other pieces around it,
1840=right?
1841=     A    I think that is right.
1842=     Q    And in your experience as an expert here,
1843=you could even make decisions about a whole region
1844=of the state and then as you start working on the
1845=adjacent region, that could cause some changes back
1846=to the region you already temporarily finished,
1847=correct?
1848=     A    I guess if you're asking, it's a 95
1849=district, 99 county puzzle.
1850=     Q    Right.  And changes in Middle Tennessee
fmt=pb
1851=can feed back into West Tennessee or feed over into
1852=East Tennessee, and all the different directions can
1853=cause further revisions to try to get the puzzle
1854=right, correct?
1855=     A    That's right.
1856=     Q    Now, when you were taking plans from the
1857=public -- I guess I'm asking you as a fact witness
1858=now, as the fact witness who was the contact for
1859=public plans submissions.  So, as fact witness Doug
1860=Himes, you agree that if Plaintiff Gary Wygant had
1861=submitted a proposal to you about whether or not to
1862=divide Gibson County on its own, that would have
1863=been rejected because it wasn't a statewide map,
1864=correct?
1865=          MR. RIEGER:  Objection.  That's
1866=     speculative.
1867=          MR. TIFT:  Well, this man ran the entire
1868=     districting process for the state on the house
1869=     side.  So I think he knows what happened when
1870=     less than statewide maps came in to him and how
1871=     he responded to them.
1872=          CHIEF JUDGE:  It seems to me if the
1873=     question is as an expert, a hypothetical
1874=     question seems more appropriate, but as a fact
1875=     witness, I would tend to exclude that.
fmt=pb
1876=          MR. TIFT:  Okay.  Well, let me phrase it
1877=     differently.
1878=     Q    (By Mr. Tift) As the map drawer, did you
1879=receive any proposals that were not statewide
1880=proposals?  You talked about four proposals and your
1881=analyses of them that came from citizens.  Do you
1882=remember those four?
1883=     A    Yes.
1884=     Q    Those were all statewide proposals,
1885=correct?
1886=     A    Correct.
1887=     Q    Did anyone attempt to submit less than a
1888=statewide proposal to you?
1889=     A    That would be outside of the guidelines.
1890=     Q    And did anyone try to submit less than a
1891=statewide plan to you?
1892=     A    I may have received email from at least
1893=one individual in Williamson County that just
1894=suggested that Spring Hill be kept together in a
1895=district.  I don't recall getting any other
1896=communication that was an attempt to just give me
1897=one piece of the puzzle.  But I did ask people to do
1898=that.
1899=     Q    All right.  And you agree you responded to
1900=that person about Spring Hill that to make a
fmt=pb
1901=proposal would require a statewide map?
1902=     A    If somebody wanted to submit a proposal
1903=under the house guidelines, it required that a
1904=statewide proposal -- because as we just talked
1905=about, it's a puzzle that doesn't work with one
1906=district.
1907=     Q    Right.  So, it was a guideline that all
1908=submissions had to be statewide, correct?
1909=     A    It was an adopted guideline.
1910=     Q    And as a result, citizens could not submit
1911=partial state or regional or just county proposals,
1912=correct?
1913=     A    They were encouraged to talk to their
1914=legislature or me.
1915=     Q    And in terms of submitting a plan to you
1916=under the guidelines, they could not do so if it was
1917=not a statewide plan?
1918=     A    They could not submit a plan to be
1919=considered by the committee unless it was a full
1920=house plan, but they were encouraged to communicate
1921=what their ideas were.
1922=     Q    And that's as you said, because it's a
1923=99-piece puzzle, you can't just see a few pieces and
1924=know how everything else is going to work?
1925=     A    Yes.  The problem with getting just one
fmt=pb
1926=district in southeast Tennessee is it can affect
1927=districts well beyond it.
1928=     Q    And as the mapmaker, you understand the
1929=decisions you made as a mapmaker had a real-life
1930=effect on Tennessee citizens, correct?
1931=     A    I understand that.
1932=     Q    And if you, Doug Himes, any one of your
1933=decisions, if it led to a constitutional violation,
1934=would have violated someone's constitutional rights,
1935=correct?
1936=          MR. RIEGER:  Objection, speculation.
1937=          CHIEF JUDGE:  I believe given that the
1938=     witness is lawyer, given the way he looked at
1939=     this, that he can answer the question as posed.
1940=     Q    (By Mr. Tift) So, you acknowledge that the
1941=decisions you, Doug Himes, make as a map drawer
1942=could ultimately lead to constitutional violations
1943=for voters, correct?
1944=     A    So, my job as the counsel for the
1945=committee has been to help them enact a
1946=constitutional and fair plan, and I have done that
1947=consistently as a nonpartisan employee for 30-plus
1948=years.  I do not want anyone to have their
1949=constitutional rights deprived.
1950=               I think Tennessee house is unique in
fmt=pb
1951=the fact that it tries to keep partisanship out of
1952=redistricting.  And that goal has always been a
1953=constitutional and fair plan.  And I have been
1954=fortunate enough to work with legislatures, both
1955=Democrats and Republicans, that share that same
1956=vision.
1957=     Q    And you just made a good point.  These
1958=aren't ultimately your decisions.  They are the
1959=members decisions, correct?
1960=     A    At the end of the day, I don't make
1961=policy.
1962=     Q    And you agree we are not privy to any of
1963=the members' decisions here, correct?  Under the
1964=privilege we have just been speaking about, any
1965=member communication with you are not before the
1966=Court, correct?
1967=     A    I understand that.  But I can assure you
1968=that the house has always, always had --
1969=     Q    Respectfully, Mr. Himes, you can't assure
1970=me that the process is not political at all when the
1971=political actors' communications with you are not
1972=before this Court.  I understand you are non
1973=partisan, but you work for partisan actors, correct?
1974=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, I would ask that
1975=     the witness be allowed to finish his answer
fmt=pb
1976=     before being interrupted by counsel.
1977=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Mr. Himes, if you were not
1978=     finished with your answer, you can complete it.
1979=          THE WITNESS:  Thank you.  I would just say
1980=     that I wouldn't in my career and my resume
1981=     reflects that I will not work for a person that
1982=     doesn't share the same regard of the
1983=     Constitution that I do.
1984=     Q    (By Mr. Tift) Okay.  And you have worked
1985=for partisan politicians for the last 30 years
1986=ultimately, correct, you haven't worked for
1987=Independents?
1988=     A    That's incorrect.
1989=     Q    Is it not accurate that you worked under
1990=Democratic Speaker Naifeh?
1991=     A    That is correct.
1992=     Q    You worked under Republican Speaker
1993=Harwell?
1994=     A    That is correct.
1995=     Q    Republican Speaker Williams?
1996=     A    That's incorrect.  Speaker Williams was an
1997=Independent.
1998=     Q    So you have worked under Democrats,
1999=Independents, and Republicans and you have worked at
2000=their appointment, correct?
fmt=pb
2001=     A    I have worked for at one point the entire
2002=legislature and now for the House of
2003=Representatives.
2004=     Q    And you have agreed that the members of
2005=the General Assembly gave you priorities and
2006=feedback on the maps as you were drafting them that
2007=you worked to incorporate into the maps as possible,
2008=though we are not privy to what those priorities
2009=were, correct?
2010=     A    I think earlier you overstated the
2011=direction.  There are times that I need direction
2012=when I do a concept.  But the concept is built on
2013=the eight criteria that the General Assembly uses.
2014=It's only the areas that I need to know from them
2015=where to contract a district.  And that's where I
2016=need guidance.  Or, you know, how many districts in
2017=Shelby?  Is this concept to be 13 or 14?  That's the
2018=type of guidance that helps me be able to use those
2019=factors to create a constitutional plan.
2020=     Q    But you acknowledge that we are not privy
2021=in this case to any guidance that you got from
2022=members, correct?
2023=     A    I think that's what I have heard, yes.
2024=     Q    And did you not tell me in your deposition
2025=that you met with almost every member during the
fmt=pb
2026=redistricting process?
2027=     A    Yes, I did.  I met with, during this
2028=process, as the concept, it becomes 598, I meet with
2029=hopefully all 99.  This time it was all 99.  The
2030=last time it was only 98.  And what they see is
2031=where their residence will be in the district.
2032=     Q    Well, we can't talk about your
2033=communications with them.  So, you have met with all
2034=the members and acknowledge that you have taken
2035=feedback from many members?
2036=     A    Yes.
2037=     Q    All right.  When I refer to the enacted
2038=house map, I'm referring to Chapter 598.  You agree
2039=that that's what I mean when I say enacted house
2040=map?
2041=     A    Yes.
2042=     Q    Also codified at TCA 3.1.103?
2043=     A    Yes.
2044=     Q    Okay.  I would like to hand you now a copy
2045=of Lockert I, the first of the Lockert cases.  And
2046=you have testified you agree you have read Lockert
2047=before?
2048=     A    I have.
2049=     Q    Can I direct you to Page 12 of the
2050=printout that you have?
fmt=pb
2051=     A    I'm there.
2052=     Q    Okay.  And the paragraph that's case cite
2053=715, 3, the right column here that ends "We hold
2054=part of that."  The numbered paragraph 3 on the
2055=right column?
2056=     A    I think I am there.
2057=     Q    You see how that paragraph ends, "We hold
2058=that the plan adopted must cross as few county lines
2059=as is necessary to comply with the federal
2060=constitutional requirements."
2061=     A    Yes.
2062=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, before we go any
2063=     further down what I expect will be the line, we
2064=     would like to lodge the same standing objection
2065=     that Plaintiffs did, which is that any
2066=     interpretation of what Lockert means or the
2067=     Tennessee Constitution will ultimately be done
2068=     by the Courts and not subject to Mr. Himes'
2069=     understanding of it in terms of what the case
2070=     actually means and what the Supreme Court
2071=     actually did.
2072=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Noted for the record.  Thank
2073=     you.
2074=     Q    (By Mr. Tift) First, as fact witness Doug
2075=Himes, what's your understanding of the federal
fmt=pb
2076=constitutional requirements issued here in Lockert,
2077=which federal constitutional requirements do you
2078=understand the Supreme Court to have referred to?
2079=     A    One person, one vote.
2080=     Q    Okay.  And you agree they also in this
2081=opinion were considering the Equal Protection
2082=Clause's dilution of minority votes, correct?
2083=     A    Yes.
2084=     Q    Do you agree those are the two federal
2085=constitutional requirements referenced in Lockert I?
2086=     A    Yes.
2087=     Q    Okay.  And you were not asked in your role
2088=as expert Doug Himes to opine on whether the enacted
2089=map crossed as few county lines as necessary to
2090=comply with federal constitutional requirements,
2091=correct?
2092=     A    That is correct.
2093=     Q    And you were also not asked to do any new
2094=map drawing to explore any other potential maps that
2095=you could have created, correct?
2096=     A    That's correct.
2097=     Q    And you didn't do so because you weren't
2098=asked to?
2099=     A    That is correct.
2100=     Q    In your capacity as expert?
fmt=pb
2101=     A    That's correct.
2102=     Q    In fact, you have done no affirmative work
2103=as an expert to see if the General Assembly could
2104=have enacted a house map based on 2020 census data
2105=with fewer county splits while still complying with
2106=federal constitutional requirements, correct?
2107=     A    That's correct.
2108=     Q    You never took the enacted map and put it
2109=into Maptitude and then edit it to see if you could
2110=reduce county splits but still comply with one
2111=person, one vote and the equal protection clause?
2112=     A    I was not asked to do that.
2113=     Q    And you never put the enacted house map in
2114=Maptitude to see if you could reduce county splits
2115=but still comply with Voting Rights Act, correct?
2116=     A    I wasn't asked to do that.
2117=     Q    And you also didn't start from any other
2118=beginning point.  You didn't go to Maptitude with a
2119=blank slate and see if you could create an overall
2120=state map with fewer county splits than the enacted
2121=house map while still complying with federal
2122=constitutional requirements, right?
2123=     A    That's correct.  I wasn't asked to do
2124=that.
2125=     Q    You also didn't start neither from the
fmt=pb
2126=enacted house map nor from scratch but from some
2127=other starting point to try to create a map that
2128=divide fewer counties than the enacted house map
2129=while still complying with federal constitutional
2130=requirements, right?
2131=     A    I was not asked to do that.
2132=     Q    As an expert, you didn't do any mapmaking
2133=or analysis to determine if the 2020 census results
2134=for Tennessee allow a house redistricting map with
2135=fewer county lines crossed than the enacted house
2136=map while still complying with federal
2137=constitutional requirements?
2138=     A    I did not attempt to create a map like
2139=that.
2140=     Q    And you used Maptitude in your
2141=redistricting work, correct?
2142=     A    That is correct.
2143=     Q    Did you say you have used that for the
2144=last three cycles or just the last two?
2145=     A    The house or the General Assembly, one or
2146=the other has used it since the late '90s, so the
2147=end of Plan A and B.
2148=     Q    Okay.  And so for all three redistricting
2149=efforts 2000s, 2010s, 2022 that you were the lead
2150=on, that was all Maptitude?
fmt=pb
2151=     A    That is correct.
2152=     Q    Okay.  And you prefer Maptitude to Dave's
2153=Redistricting App, correct?
2154=     A    That's correct.
2155=     Q    And in December when we had our
2156=deposition, you said one of your criticisms of
2157=Dave's Redistricting App is that it is "limited in
2158=its ability to pick up noncontiguous districts,"
2159=correct?
2160=     A    That's what I said in my experience with
2161=it.
2162=     Q    Right.  And that was back in December of
2163=2022, correct?
2164=     A    Yes.
2165=     Q    And at that time your experience was that
2166=Dave's Redistricting App had trouble recognizing
2167=noncontiguous districts?
2168=     A    That is correct.
2169=     Q    Now, you have already testified you
2170=weren't asked in your role as expert to opine on
2171=whether the enacted house map crosses as few county
2172=lines as necessary to comply with federal
2173=constitutional requirements, correct?
2174=     A    I'm sorry.  Could you --
2175=     Q    Yes.  You have already testified, you
fmt=pb
2176=weren't asked to opine on whether or not the enacted
2177=house map crosses as few county lines as necessary
2178=to comply with federal constitutional requirements,
2179=right?
2180=     A    That's right.
2181=     Q    And as an expert, you do not have an
2182=opinion on whether or not the enacted house map
2183=split as few counties as necessary to comply with
2184=federal constitutional requirements?
2185=     A    I believe I said I think it's
2186=theoretically possible that you could split fewer
2187=counties.
2188=     Q    Okay.  So, you don't have an opinion that
2189=30 is the magic number, that 30 is the fewest that
2190=could have been split to still comply with federal
2191=constitutional requirements, correct?
2192=     A    I don't think I have the opinion.  Thirty
2193=is what's in 598, but I think I have said I think
2194=that it's theoretically possible that it could be
2195=below that.
2196=     Q    Right.  And since your opinion is that
2197=it's theoretically possible, that inherently means
2198=that your opinion is not that 30 is the fewest
2199=splits, correct?
2200=     A    I don't think it's the magic number
fmt=pb
2201=necessarily.
2202=     Q    And you don't have an opinion in this case
2203=as an expert about whether or not the enacted house
2204=map split as few counties as necessary to comply
2205=with the Voting Rights Act, correct?
2206=     A    I'm sorry, one more time.
2207=     Q    Sure.  And I can ask them over and over.
2208=You don't have an opinion as an expert on whether
2209=the house map divides counties only as necessary to
2210=comply with the Voting Rights Act?
2211=     A    Only in the extent that I would say that
2212=it does divide the counties that's necessary in West
2213=Tennessee to comply.  It does do what.
2214=     Q    All right.  But overall the statewide map,
2215=you don't have an opinion on whether the statewide
2216=map divides counties only as necessary to comply
2217=with the Federal Constitution and the Voting Rights
2218=Act, or you think it's theoretically possible that
2219=there could be fewer?
2220=     A    Overall, not limited to just the VRA.  The
2221=VRA I do think it splits counties because of the
2222=Voting Rights Act.
2223=     Q    So you think the map is Voting Rights Act
2224=compliant?
2225=     A    I believe it is.
fmt=pb
2226=     Q    Okay.  And you don't have an opinion on
2227=whether or not the map splits counties only as
2228=necessary to comply with federal constitutional
2229=requirements?
2230=     A    And by saying federal constitutional
2231=requirements, you're doing the one person, one vote,
2232=not VRA, right?
2233=     Q    Well, the constitutional requirements that
2234=Lockert just spoke about, that we just looked at,
2235=which are the Equal Protection Clause, not talking
2236=about the Voting Rights Act?
2237=     A    Again, I think it's theoretically possible
2238=to draw a plan that might split fewer than 30.
2239=     Q    And as an expert in this case, you also
2240=have no opinion concerning whether the General
2241=Assembly actually tried to create a house map with
2242=as few county splitting districts as needed for
2243=federal constitutional compliance, right?
2244=     A    As expert, I wasn't asked to evaluate 598.
2245=I think that's what you have asked?
2246=     Q    I'm confirming you have no opinion on
2247=whether the General Assembly itself actually tried
2248=to pass a house map with as few county splits as
2249=needed for federal constitutional requirements?
2250=     A    I wouldn't know that.
fmt=pb
2251=     Q    And you were at the public hearings,
2252=correct?
2253=     A    I was.
2254=     Q    Not as an expert, as a mapmaker.  But you
2255=still remember the public hearings?
2256=     A    I do.
2257=     Q    And you agree at the public hearings,
2258=there was no testimony showing that the General
2259=Assembly, in fact, tried to have as few county
2260=splits as necessary to comply with federal
2261=constitutional requirements?
2262=     A    Yeah.  There's no testimony about all the
2263=30 county splits.
2264=     Q    And are you aware as an expert, you know,
2265=experts can look at any documents they are given.
2266=As an expert, have you reviewed any documents that
2267=show you that the General Assembly actually tried to
2268=create as few county splits in the house map as
2269=needed for federal constitutional compliance?
2270=     A    I haven't seen a document that has
2271=something like that in it.
2272=     Q    And so walling off any subjective
2273=knowledge Doug Himes the mapmaker has, Doug Himes
2274=the expert doesn't have any opinions on whether the
2275=General Assembly actually tried to create a house
fmt=pb
2276=map with as few county divides as necessitated by
2277=federal constitutional requirements?
2278=     A    So, I think 598 is constitutional with
2279=it's 30 splits, but I also think it's theoretically
2280=possible that you could have a competing plan.
2281=     Q    Well, I'm no longer asking you about
2282=possibility.  I'm asking you about what your expert
2283=opinion is about what the General Assembly tried to
2284=do.  And walling off your subjective knowledge of
2285=what the General Assembly actually tried to do, as
2286=an expert looking at documents that are publicly
2287=available, looking at the map itself, you don't have
2288=an opinion about whether the General Assembly
2289=actually tried to pass a map with as few county
2290=splitting districts as needed for federal
2291=constitutional requirements?
2292=     A    I would say that 598 is a constitutionally
2293=compliant plan.
2294=     Q    That doesn't even remotely answer my
2295=question.  They question is, I'm asking about the
2296=General Assembly's intent.  As an expert in this
2297=case, do you have an opinion about whether the
2298=General Assembly itself actually tried to create a
2299=house map with county splits only as many as
2300=necessary for federal constitutional requirements,
fmt=pb
2301=if that was their actual intent?
2302=     A    So as an expert, do I know if they have
2303=tried, no.  But as an expert looking at the plan,
2304=provided a constitutional reason for the 30 splits.
2305=     Q    Sure.  There's no question you think the
2306=map is constitutional.  But as you just confirmed,
2307=as an expert, you don't have an opinion about the
2308=General Assembly actually trying to create as few as
2309=necessary for federal constitutional requirements,
2310=right?
2311=     A    I think as an expert, I wouldn't know
2312=that.
2313=     Q    And you would agree that nothing publicly
2314=available demonstrates to anyone that 30 splits was
2315=the magic number, meaning the fewest county splits
2316=needed, for federal constitutional requirements,
2317=right?
2318=     A    I don't know of anything that says it has
2319=to be 30.
2320=     Q    And you agree the enacted house map on
2321=itself looking at it, analyzing it, the enacted
2322=house map itself does not demonstrate just on its
2323=face that it crosses as few county lines as
2324=necessary to comply with federal constitutional
2325=requirements, right?
fmt=pb
2326=     A    I think it's theoretically possible that
2327=you may be able to produce something that has fewer
2328=splits.
2329=     Q    So you agree the map itself, you don't
2330=just look at it and analyze it and it doesn't tell
2331=on its own that that is the fewest county splits
2332=needed to comply with federal constitutional
2333=requirements, right?
2334=     A    You wouldn't be able to look at any map
2335=and know that without analyzing it and looking at it
2336=a little deeper.
2337=     Q    Right.  And at your deposition, in fact,
2338=you said you would have to try to draw a better map
2339=to figure that out, right?
2340=     A    That's right.
2341=     Q    And you didn't try to draw a better map as
2342=an expert?
2343=     A    I wasn't asked to.
2344=     Q    Sure.  And you didn't?
2345=     A    That is correct.
2346=     Q    Okay.  Have you ever tried to create a
2347=house map using 2020 census data for Tennessee with
2348=fewer than 30 county splitting districts?
2349=          MR. RIEGER:  I will maintain my objection
2350=     to the extent that that calls for any sorts of
fmt=pb
2351=     draft maps that would be protected by
2352=     attorney-client privilege work product.
2353=          CHIEF JUDGE:  I'm going to overrule the
2354=     objection.  Go ahead.
2355=          MR. TIFT:  Well, Your Honor, unless they
2356=     are waiving the privilege, I'm pointing out
2357=     just the problem in the reality that he has
2358=     some subjective knowledge that he can't tell us
2359=     about.  So I anticipate the objection, and I
2360=     think on the Court's prior ruling, unless we
2361=     are going to go back and do discovery on his
2362=     draft maps, I would ask that he not be able to
2363=     testify about before he was an expert if he
2364=     ever did so.
2365=          CHIEF JUDGE:  All right.
2366=     Q    (By Mr. Tift) So you don't need to answer.
2367=               Now, you testified that it's your
2368=opinion that you and Ellen Tewes, who you mentioned
2369=before, are probably the two living people with the
2370=most knowledge about house redistricting in
2371=Tennessee, correct?
2372=     A    That is correct.
2373=     Q    And there's been discussion in the case
2374=about avoiding litigation risk.  You agree there
2375=hasn't been any federal challenge to Tennessee maps
fmt=pb
2376=since the 1990s, correct?
2377=     A    Federal challenge, there has not.
2378=     Q    And the first map you did 2000s, no
2379=lawsuits?
2380=     A    There was none on the plan.  I think there
2381=was one that we didn't redistrict soon enough.
2382=     Q    And then, the 2010 map, there was limited
2383=litigation on the senate side concerning county
2384=splits?
2385=     A    The Moore case.
2386=     Q    So those are the only cases in the last 25
2387=or so years, correct?
2388=     A    And I think that shows that the General
2389=Assembly takes it constitutional obligation pretty
2390=seriously.
2391=          MR. TIFT:  And just to clarify the record,
2392=     I just do want to clarify the Panel hasn't
2393=     modified its ruling on privilege, the Motion
2394=     the Compel and your ruling still stand?
2395=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Yes.
2396=     Q    (By Mr. Tift) All right.  I would like to
2397=direct you now back to your expert report.  That's
2398=Exhibit 14.  Now, I understand you wrote this report
2399=yourself, correct?
2400=     A    That is correct.
fmt=pb
2401=     Q    The lawyers for the Defendants did not
2402=write this report?
2403=     A    That's right.
2404=     Q    And you wrote the legal analysis in this
2405=brief, as well?
2406=     A    That is correct.
2407=     Q    I called it a brief.  I meant report.  You
2408=wrote the legal analysis in this report?
2409=     A    That's right.
2410=     Q    And we'll go to Page 38, footnote 12,
2411=which was addressed earlier.  And so you wrote
2412=footnote 12 yourself, correct?
2413=     A    That's correct.
2414=     Q    And as an expert you provided this
2415=footnote reflective of your analysis of the map,
2416=correct?
2417=     A    That's correct.
2418=     Q    And this footnote comes off of a sentence
2419=midway through that states, "Each split is justified
2420=by a legitimate redistricting objective, such as,
2421=population, the Voting Rights Act, or other criteria
2422=utilized by the Tennessee House of Representatives
2423=for state house redistricting."  Did I read that
2424=correctly?
2425=     A    You did.
fmt=pb
2426=     Q    And then your footnote states at the
2427=start, "Chapter 598 Split Counties and
2428=Justifications," correct?
2429=     A    That is correct.
2430=     Q    Now, nothing I have read states that
2431=there's other justifications you didn't write down,
2432=correct?
2433=     A    I think you read what it says, yes.
2434=     Q    Okay.  And you wrote this, I guess, either
2435=late October or early November of 2022?
2436=     A    Yes.
2437=     Q    So in November of 2022, you listed the
2438=reason for Carroll County's division as core
2439=preservation, correct?
2440=     A    Yes.
2441=     Q    And in November of 2022, you listed the
2442=reason for Dickson's division as core preservation
2443=and incumbents, correct?
2444=     A    That's correct.
2445=     Q    And in November of 2022, you listed the
2446=division of Fentress as core preservation, correct?
2447=     A    Yes.
2448=     Q    And at that time, you listed Hardin's
2449=justification as core preservation, right?
2450=     A    That's correct.
fmt=pb
2451=     Q    And you listed Monroe as core
2452=preservation, correct?
2453=     A    I'm sorry, which county?
2454=     Q    Monroe.
2455=     A    That is correct.
2456=     Q    And you agree from the multicolored chart,
2457=that several of the counties on here are ones with
2458=more population than a district that would have one,
2459=two, or three full districts in them and then
2460=require a split, correct?
2461=     A    From the chart on whatever that was.
2462=     Q    It was 105.  Feel free to look at it.  But
2463=you agree that a subset of these counties are more
2464=than one county in population, and the balance of
2465=full districts requires a split, correct?
2466=     A    I think that's right.  You are saying the
2467=ones that have more than one or two and have access,
2468=it has to be split, like Madison and Maury and those
2469=folks.
2470=     Q    And you listed that on this report, right,
2471=when that was the case?
2472=     A    On here, I think all those should say that
2473=it was population.  Just that was the descriptive
2474=term for it.
2475=     Q    And do you have the big map?
fmt=pb
2476=     A    Yes.
2477=     Q    There are also occasions where the stop
2478=sign requires a split?  That's your term, stop sign,
2479=correct?
2480=     A    Yes.
2481=     Q    And I'm look at far East Tennessee.  You
2482=noted that Greene County is a full district?
2483=     A    Correct.
2484=     Q    Washington is a full two districts?
2485=     A    Correct.
2486=     Q    Unicoi is quite small, it's under 20,000,
2487=right?
2488=     A    That's correct.
2489=     Q    So, it has to be paired with some county,
2490=correct?
2491=     A    Right.
2492=     Q    And you can't go into Greene because that
2493=one is not divided?
2494=     A    Correct.
2495=     Q    You can't go into Washington?
2496=     A    Right.
2497=     Q    Unicoi is not okay on its on?
2498=     A    Correct.
2499=     Q    And Carter has 56,356, correct?
2500=     A    56,356, that's correct.
fmt=pb
2501=     Q    So Unicoi and Carter can't be paired
2502=together as one whole district, because then you
2503=would be above the 73,000 top number, correct?
2504=     A    Yes.  I believe if you added them both
2505=together it would be too much population.
2506=     Q    And that's maybe an example of where an
2507=under-one district county has to be split based on
2508=the stop signs, correct?
2509=     A    Correct.  There's only one way to get out
2510=of there.
2511=     Q    And you said so, that justification in
2512=this footnote, correct?  If you look at Carter
2513=County, population shift --
2514=     A    And core preservation and county
2515=splitting, yes.
2516=     Q    Okay.  But back in November, for seven of
2517=the 30 counties, you did not say population shift.
2518=You listed only core preservation or core
2519=preservation and incumbent protection, correct?
2520=     A    There are six that just list core
2521=preservation, and one that lists core preservation
2522=and incumbents.  Only one lists incumbents.
2523=     Q    And you created this as an expert
2524=analyzing the map, not as the drawer of substantive
2525=reasoning behind the map, correct?
fmt=pb
2526=     A    I did this independent for this report at
2527=the time of the report.
2528=     Q    So, even if you had personal knowledge
2529=about any reason for a split having to do with
2530=anything that a member told you, that's not
2531=reflected in this footnote, correct?
2532=     A    That's correct.  I prepared this footnote
2533=just based on this report looking at the map and the
2534=populations.
2535=     Q    So, we heard about the retiring member
2536=from Gibson County.  I'm not saying that he did, but
2537=if he had asked Speaker Sexton either to divide or
2538=not divide Gibson, if he had come to you with that
2539=request, as mapmaker, that would not be reflected in
2540=this report, correct?
2541=     A    I don't think I could have.
2542=     Q    Right.  So this is your expert analysis.
2543=And at that time, six counties were listed as just
2544=core preservation, and one is core preservation and
2545=incumbent protection, correct?
2546=     A    That is correct.
2547=     Q    And you agree that incumbent protection
2548=cannot justify a Tennessee county split under the
2549=Lockert decisions, correct?
2550=     A    I think the litany of those decisions say
fmt=pb
2551=that there are going to be some political
2552=considerations, and it's one of the criteria that
2553=the house has, is minimizing incumbent pairing.
2554=     Q    And you agree that the Supreme Court in
2555=Lockert II invalidated the split of Washington
2556=County, because the stated reason for splitting
2557=Washington was incumbency protection, correct?
2558=     A    Was that the senate district?
2559=     Q    Well, you have reviewed these, right, you
2560=spoke about being knowledgable about the Lockert
2561=cases?
2562=     A    Yes, I know the cases.  But I also focused
2563=on house redistricting.  I agree that that's what it
2564=says.  I also would say that when you go to Lincoln
2565=County and you have the same scenario and it's not
2566=invalidated.  And in the case of Dickson County,
2567=it's not just because of the incumbents.  There
2568=happens to be incumbents, and for the purpose of
2569=this, I listed that, but it also has the core
2570=preservation.
2571=     Q    Mr. Himes, I know you are one of the two
2572=living people with the most knowledge about these
2573=cases.  So you are aware of Lockert, correct?
2574=     A    I'm aware of it.
2575=     Q    We are now looking at Lockert II, which is
fmt=pb
2576=the 1983 decision.  Lockert II concerned both senate
2577=maps and house maps, correct?
2578=     A    That's right.  There's a little bit of
2579=each.
2580=     Q    I'm going to direct you to Page 4 of the
2581=West printout.  We are between 839 and 840 in the
2582=Southwest second?
2583=     A    Okay.  I'm in that area.
2584=     Q    Section II of the Court's opinion.
2585=     A    Okay.
2586=     Q    And in the first paragraph, the Court
2587=writes:
2588=          "Chapter 909, Public Acts 1982 divides the
2589=     state into thirty-three Senatorial districts
2590=     that have a total variation of 10.76% from the
2591=     one person, one vote optimum population per
2592=     district of 139,114. That variance was produced
2593=     by district twenty-six's over population
2594=     variance of 6.69% and district nineteen's under
2595=     population variance of 4.07%. Chapter 909 split
2596=     Washington County into two parts. The eastern
2597=     part was joined with Carter and Johnson
2598=     Counties to form district one. The western part
2599=     was placed in district three with Greene,
2600=     Hawkins and Hancock Counties. Frank Hinton,
fmt=pb
2601=     director of the division of local government in
2602=     the comptroller's office, testified that he
2603=     served as principal staff person for the senate
2604=     Reapportionment Sub-committee and that he was
2605=     instructed to avoid placing the two incumbents
2606=     who reside in Washington County in a single
2607=     district. On cross examination he testified
2608=     that dividing Washington County did not
2609=     diminish the total variance and that
2610=     eliminating the division of Washington County
2611=     would not increase the variance.
2612=          We affirm the chancellor in holding that
2613=     any plan that splits Washington County is
2614=     unconstitutional."
2615=          So in this section I just read, you agree
2616=     that the stated justification for dividing
2617=     Washington County by Mr. Hinton, director of
2618=     the division of local government was to protect
2619=     two incumbents, and the Court rejected dividing
2620=     a county based on that, correct?
2621=     A    Based on that situation, that's what this
2622=says this.
2623=     Q    And the Court can decide if that means
2624=that incumbency is a valid reason to divide a
2625=County, is what you are saying?
fmt=pb
2626=     A    Minimizing incumbency is the criteria that
2627=the house has as one of its eight criteria it uses.
2628=Dickson is identified as both incumbents.  There
2629=just happens to be two there.  Historically, there's
2630=been the two districts in Dickson County in the
2631=core.  Unlike that, if you removed that split,
2632=unless you did something differently, you would have
2633=a population variance.  At the end of the day, all
2634=of these are subject to that, to the equal
2635=population.
2636=     Q    You agree that under Lockert, we just read
2637=Lockert I, that the Court says you shall not cross
2638=county lines other than for federal constitutional
2639=requirements, right?
2640=     A    That is correct.
2641=     Q    And you agree that core preservation is
2642=not a federal constitutional requirement, right?
2643=     A    I would agree that it is not specifically
2644=a federal constitutional requirement, but it is
2645=illustrative of a principle that can justify under
2646=one person, one vote the reason for a deviation.
2647=     Q    Core preservation is not written in the
2648=Federal Constitution, correct?
2649=     A    I agree with you.
2650=     Q    And at your deposition, you agreed that it
fmt=pb
2651=is not a federal constitutional requirement,
2652=correct?
2653=     A    I agree with you.
2654=     Q    And you agree that preserving cores
2655=doesn't always increase or decrease or keep the same
2656=variations.  Sometimes preserving a core will
2657=increase the variation, sometimes preserving a core
2658=will decrease the variations, and sometimes it
2659=might, unlikely, keep it exactly the same?
2660=     A    Right.  And that's the reason why it's
2661=helpful with the deviation.
2662=     Q    You also agree that incumbency protection
2663=is not stated in the United States Constitution,
2664=correct?
2665=     A    It is not.
2666=     Q    It's not stated in the state Constitution
2667=either, correct?
2668=     A    It is not.
2669=     Q    It's not even stated in the statutory
2670=guidelines from the General Assembly, correct?
2671=     A    No.  Incumbency protection is not the
2672=practice either.  It's minimizing incumbent pairing.
2673=     Q    Okay.  You can call it that.  So
2674=minimizing incumbent pairings is not in the
2675=Constitution or the statute, correct?
fmt=pb
2676=     A    It is not.
2677=     Q    Okay.  And so in November of 2022, this is
2678=the footnotes you wrote, and you agree from having
2679=reviewed subsequent pleadings that upon the Summary
2680=Judgment, Plaintiffs through counsel, have heavily
2681=highlighted the fact that you, Defendants' witness,
2682=have seven counties where all you list are
2683=non-federal requirements for dividing counties,
2684=correct?
2685=     A    I understand that.
2686=     Q    And now in trial, as the man who drafted
2687=the maps and the man who is responsible in his job
2688=for making constitutional maps, is now the expert to
2689=defend those maps, you are adding reasons that
2690=weren't stated in here and saying, well, they were
2691=actually all for population, correct?
2692=     A    Well, I don't think it would have been
2693=very helpful as an expert to put population equality
2694=on everything that's here.
2695=     Q    You don't think it would be helpful in a
2696=redistricting lawsuit where the Federal
2697=Constitution's one person, one vote requirement, by
2698=your own admission is the most important
2699=requirement, to not list that when it was affecting
2700=counties?
fmt=pb
2701=     A    I would expect that everyone would
2702=understand that.  This was just offered as an
2703=explanation under the standards.
2704=     Q    So as the expert before criticism, you
2705=thought the Court would assume that all splits were
2706=based on population variance?
2707=     A    I think it's evident when you look at the
2708=map.  Core preservation is part of one person, one
2709=vote.
2710=     Q    But you just said it's not evident from
2711=the map whether or not the enacted house map divided
2712=as few counties as necessary to comply with federal
2713=constitutional requirements, right?
2714=     A    You wouldn't be able to tell that from the
2715=map, but if you look at the populations of each of
2716=the individual districts and the portions of those
2717=populations that are part of those counties, you
2718=would know that they all fit between 5.09 and the
2719=negative 4.81.
2720=     Q    And you listed population for many of
2721=these counties.  You didn't list it for a number of
2722=them.  But the Court and the parties were supposed
2723=to understand that you implied population for all 30
2724=of them?
2725=     A    When I listed population in the sense in
fmt=pb
2726=here, it was to signify -- you can see -- it's only
2727=those counties that have excess population for a
2728=whole number that have to be split.  Those are the
2729=have to be split counties.  That's all that that
2730=meant was if you had Madison County, it would list
2731=population.  If you had Wilson County, it would list
2732=population.
2733=     Q    Right.  So when a county truly had to be
2734=divided for population reasons, you listed
2735=population?
2736=     A    That's right.
2737=     Q    But you didn't list it for all of them.
2738=And you agree that for many of the under one
2739=district population counties, depending on how the
2740=puzzle pieces are put together, they either could be
2741=split or could not be split?
2742=     A    I agree with you.
2743=     Q    And, Mr. Himes, you haven't been paid in
2744=addition as an expert for this case, correct?
2745=     A    I have not.
2746=     Q    You are just receiving your state salary?
2747=     A    That's correct.
2748=     Q    And one of your primary jobs as a state
2749=employee and your job each ten years is to ensure a
2750=constitutional map is enacted, correct?
fmt=pb
2751=     A    Yes.
2752=     Q    And you're the expert defending the map
2753=you drew, correct?
2754=     A    That is the case, it seems.
2755=     Q    Now, when you reviewed Dr. Cervas' various
2756=maps, you exported the underlying files to
2757=Maptitude, correct?
2758=     A    Yes.  I would take the Dave's link, make a
2759=CVS file and then download it to Maptitude.  Is that
2760=what you are asking me?
2761=     Q    Yes.
2762=     A    Yes.
2763=     Q    And if I could direct you to Exhibit 89.
2764=It's Exhibit 89 and the cover page says Exhibit 6,
2765=affidavit of Doug Himes.  Do you see that?
2766=     A    I do.
2767=     Q    And this is an affidavit you signed on
2768=January 20th, 2003?
2769=     A    Yes, that's what it says.
2770=     Q    Do you recall signing it?
2771=     A    I recall signing it.  It's my signature.
2772=     Q    And this affidavit provides your format,
2773=the format you have used and we have looked at
2774=several times, analyses of 13c, d, and d_e?
2775=     A    It does with the proviso, it does not have
fmt=pb
2776=the paired incumbents on it.
2777=     Q    Right.  And 13c, you agree, does not have
2778=any constitutional deficiencies, correct?
2779=     A    The only thing different than the enacted
2780=plan is it has a slightly higher overall deviation.
2781=     Q    And that deviation, the difference is
2782=.06 percent, correct?
2783=     A    That is correct.
2784=     Q    Okay.  And let me know if you need a pen
2785=and paper, but the average ideal district is 69,806,
2786=correct?
2787=     A    That is correct.
2788=     Q    So, 10 percent of that would be 6,980.6,
2789=correct?
2790=     A    I think I'll need more than a pen and
2791=paper.
2792=     Q    I'll get my phone.  You can use a
2793=calculator.
2794=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, we're fine with
2795=     Mr. Himes using the phone calculator here.
2796=     However, we would just like to note that math
2797=     is math.  And to the extent if he puts in a
2798=     number and it ends up not mathematically being
2799=     the number, we would hope that the parties
2800=     could agree to not be bound in case the math
fmt=pb
2801=     goes awry here.
2802=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Good point.  Thank you.
2803=          MR. TIFT:  Could we short circuit this?
2804=     Would counsel agree that .01 percent of 69,806
2805=     is 6.98.
2806=          MR. RIEGER:  You're going to have to do
2807=     that a little bit slower for me.
2808=          MR. TIFT:  I'm multiplying 69,806 times
2809=     .00 --
2810=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, we're fine to
2811=     just in posttrial briefing stipulating that
2812=     math is math.
2813=          MR. TIFT:  We can stipulate to math being
2814=     math.
2815=          THE WITNESS:  I'm not good at math.
2816=     Q    (By Mr. Tift) Do you have any idea, let's
2817=say, as either mapmaker or expert about how many
2818=people are represented of .06 percent variation?
2819=     A    Just going through that demonstration, I'm
2820=not very good at math.  I wouldn't want to speculate
2821=what the number would be.  It won't be thousands of
2822=people.
2823=     Q    It's actually 42, correct?
2824=     A    I don't know the answer to it.
2825=     Q    Okay.  The total variance of map 13c is
fmt=pb
2826=9.96, correct?
2827=     A    Correct.
2828=     Q    And that means that in one of two
2829=districts, either the top district or the bottom
2830=district, there's .06 percent more or fewer people,
2831=correct?
2832=     A    We're in a combination of districts, yeah,
2833=but somewhere it's higher.
2834=     Q    But it has to be in the top or the bottom
2835=for it to affect total deviation, correct?
2836=     A    Yes.  It could be a lower or higher
2837=populated district or multiple.
2838=     Q    And you did not identify any noncontiguous
2839=census block in 13c, correct?
2840=     A    I think that's correct.
2841=     Q    And you agree 13c has the exact same 13
2842=majority-minority districts as the enacted house
2843=map, correct?
2844=     A    That is correct.
2845=     Q    And it's with six fewer counties than the
2846=enacted house map, correct?
2847=     A    Yes.
2848=     Q    And I understand you do criticize it for
2849=having a worse core preservation and worse incumbent
2850=pairing, correct?
fmt=pb
2851=     A    Do we have a copy that I could look at, or
2852=it's in my expert report before?  Because the page
2853=we're on does not reflect those criticisms.
2854=     Q    If you don't remember the criticisms, we
2855=don't have to talk about them now.  Your counsel
2856=could on Re-direct.
2857=     A    There are too many of them for me to
2858=remember.
2859=     Q    Okay.  And, of course, you criticize the
2860=increase of .06 percent variance as compared to the
2861=enacted house map, correct?
2862=     A    It's higher.  It's something that is a
2863=factor that you have to think about.
2864=     Q    And you agree that redistricting, by its
2865=very nature, requires some loss of core of prior
2866=district, correct?
2867=     A    Certainly.
2868=     Q    That's because population moves so
2869=districts have to change?
2870=     A    As I said, three actual districts had to
2871=leave where they were and move to Middle Tennessee.
2872=     Q    And you're aware, correct, that Dr. Cervas
2873=did not have incumbent addresses before he produced
2874=his first report, correct?
2875=     A    The first set of reports, yes.
fmt=pb
2876=     Q    And you agree it's hard to avoid pairing
2877=incumbents if you don't know where they live?
2878=     A    That's very true.
2879=     Q    All right.  And you agree that you and
2880=fact witness Doug Himes do have the addresses of the
2881=members to aid in considering incumbent pairings?
2882=     A    Yes.  Accurately, hopefully.
2883=     Q    And that's important because incumbents
2884=have to live in the districts, and you want to try
2885=to avoid incumbent pairings?
2886=     A    We want to minimize the incumbent
2887=pairings.
2888=     Q    And then, let's jump over two pages the
2889=13d_e.  This is your review of 13d_e, correct?
2890=     A    Yes, it is.
2891=     Q    The copy I have cuts off your footnote.
2892=Does yours only have two lines of the footnote?
2893=     A    It does.  Or was it just a poorly written
2894=footnote?
2895=     Q    I guess I don't know.  But I direct you to
2896=Exhibit 90, which is a different affidavit from you
2897=where you provide the full information.
2898=     A    Okay.  So, yes.  This is the affidavit
2899=that was filed a little bit later, but it does set
2900=out the footnote on Page 2, I guess, is the number
fmt=pb
2901=5.
2902=          MR. TIFT:  Okay.  And so with that in
2903=     mind, I guess I would pause for a second and
2904=     move to admit 89 and 90.
2905=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Any objection?
2906=          MR. RIEGER:  No objection, Your Honor.
2907=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Exhibits 89 and 90 are
2908=     admitted to evidence without objection.
2909=                              (The above-referred to
2910=                              document was thereupon
2911=                              marked Plaintiff Exhibit
2912=                              No. 89, and is attached
2913=                              hereto.)
2914=                              (The above-referred to
2915=                              document was thereupon
2916=                              marked Plaintiff Exhibit
2917=                              No. 90, and is attached
2918=                              hereto.)
2919=     Q    (By Mr. Tift) Okay.  And so, map 13d_e
2920=that reviewed has a 9.89 percent total variation,
2921=correct?
2922=     A    That is correct.
2923=     Q    You agree that's lower than the enacted
2924=house map?
2925=     A    It is.
2926=     Q    Map 13d_e has the same 13
2927=majority-minority districts as the enacted house
2928=map, correct?
2929=     A    They may be exactly the same.
fmt=pb
2930=     Q    Right.  That's what I'm saying.
2931=     A    Yes.
2932=     Q    And you agree that map 13d_e does not
2933=include a double split in Sullivan County?
2934=     A    Yeah, this is the one that fixed that.
2935=     Q    All right.  If it helps you to look back
2936=at your 13d summary and compare it.  You note the
2937=double split in d and not in d_e, correct?
2938=     A    Yes.
2939=     Q    So you agree 13d_e does not split Sullivan
2940=County twice?
2941=     A    That is correct.
2942=     Q    Now, you also identify three noncontiguous
2943=census blocks, correct?
2944=     A    I believe that's correct.
2945=     Q    Okay.  I'm actually looking to 90 since
2946=they are all three listed there.  But in 90, you
2947=state one unpopulated, noncontiguous census block in
2948=Sullivan County was assigned to District 1, yet was
2949=within District 3.  And then you state one
2950=unpopulated, noncontiguous census block in Sullivan
2951=County was assigned to District 1, yet was between
2952=Districts 3 and 4?
2953=     A    Yes.
2954=     Q    You recall identifying those
fmt=pb
2955=noncontiguities when you put the plans in Maptitude?
2956=     A    Yes.
2957=     Q    Okay.  I'm going to show you a
2958=demonstrative that we have used earlier in the
2959=hearing.
2960=     A    Sure.
2961=     Q    Which should also be at the very last
2962=Tab of the 100 series.  I think it's 117, for you to
2963=see a closer version.  Let me know when you get to
2964=it.
2965=     A    Okay.
2966=     Q    And this, I'll represent to you, is an
2967=enlargement of this section 13d_e identifying the
2968=two noncontiguous census blocks that you identified
2969=in this affidavit.  Do you see it?
2970=     A    Yes.
2971=     Q    And do you have any reason to disagree
2972=that these are the two blocks that you located?
2973=     A    I'm sure that you would have made a map of
2974=the noncontiguous areas.
2975=     Q    And you agree both of these noncontiguous
2976=areas are zero population, correct?
2977=     A    They are very small.
2978=     Q    And you agree, for instance, pairing the
2979=top one, census block ending in 031, which is
fmt=pb
2980=assigned to District 1 but in District 3, pairing
2981=that with District 3 will not affect the total
2982=variance of the map?
2983=     A    None of the ones in this one will affect
2984=the variance and can be correct.
2985=     Q    Okay.  So, both of these two zero
2986=population, noncontiguous census blocks can be
2987=corrected without affecting the total variance of
2988=the map?
2989=     A    You can correct all the ones in this and
2990=not affect.
2991=     Q    And that applies to the 11-person,
2992=noncontiguous census block in 13d_e, correct?
2993=     A    You can correct all of them and fix them.
2994=     Q    And you can do so without changing the
2995=total 9.89 percent variance, correct?
2996=     A    Because it's very few people.
2997=     Q    Right.  Might even be close to .01 percent
2998=once we check the math, it's 11 people, correct?
2999=     A    It's very few people.
3000=     Q    And you agree that fixing these three
3001=noncontiguous will not change the number of
3002=majority-minority districts in this map, correct?
3003=     A    Not considering where they are.
3004=     Q    And you agree that correcting these three,
fmt=pb
3005=noncontiguous census blocks will not change the
3006=number of county splits, as well, correct?
3007=     A    Unless you were to assign them in an odd
3008=way, it would not.
3009=     Q    Okay.  And you agree that map 13d_e has 24
3010=county splits, correct?
3011=     A    That's the number it has.
3012=     Q    And it will still have 24 county splits
3013=after correcting the three, noncontiguous census
3014=blocks, correct?
3015=     A    It should.
3016=     Q    And the only constitutional deficiency you
3017=identified in analyzing this map was three,
3018=noncontiguous census blocks, correct?
3019=     A    In d_e, that's correct.
3020=     Q    And once those are corrected, you have no
3021=constitutional criticisms of 13d_e, correct?
3022=     A    I wouldn't.
3023=     Q    And your counsel a minute ago on several
3024=of the other maps, asked you if you still had
3025=constitutional concerns once unpopulated census
3026=blocks were corrected but did not ask you if you had
3027=constitutional concerns once these three were fixed,
3028=correct?
3029=     A    I don't recall exactly.
fmt=pb
3030=     Q    You remember being asked if 13b_e would
3031=still be unconstitutional?
3032=     A    The ones that had the splits of Madison
3033=and/or Shelby?
3034=     Q    Correct.
3035=     A    Yeah, I do recall that.
3036=     Q    All right.  But you and State's counsel
3037=did not discuss correcting these three
3038=noncontiguities, correct?
3039=     A    I don't believe so.
3040=     Q    And if you correct these three
3041=noncontiguities, this 13d_e will still have a lower
3042=variance than the enacted house map, will still have
3043=24 county splits, which is six lower than the
3044=enacted house map?
3045=     A    That is correct.
3046=     Q    And still has the same 13
3047=majority-minority districts?
3048=     A    That is correct.
3049=     Q    So 13d_e with those three corrections is a
3050=constitutional map with six fewer county splits,
3051=correct?
3052=     A    Yes.  It would be a constitutional map if
3053=it was corrected.
3054=     Q    So, let me ask you, do you now have an
fmt=pb
3055=opinion about whether the General Assembly could
3056=have, in fact, divided far fewer counties while
3057=still complying with federal constitutional
3058=requirements?
3059=     A    I would say that the General Assembly
3060=wasn't privy to Cervas house 13d_e.
3061=     Q    And I'm only asking Doug Himes the expert.
3062=Does Doug Himes the expert agree that you can have a
3063=map based on 2020 census data with six fewer splits
3064=that's constitutional under the Federal
3065=Constitution?
3066=     A    It's right there.
3067=     Q    So 13d_e, in fact, is a statewide map
3068=based on 2020 census demographics, once the three
3069=noncontiguities are fixed, it's a map that divides
3070=six fewer counties than the enacted house map, while
3071=still complying with federal constitutional
3072=requirements, right?
3073=     A    Yes.  It's indicative of a map that has 24
3074=instead of 30 splits in it.
3075=     Q    And it doesn't pose a variance threat?
3076=     A    They are almost the same.
3077=     Q    They are almost the same but it is lower?
3078=     A    It is lower.
3079=     Q    It may only be 6.9 people or 11 people
fmt=pb
3080=lower but it is lower, correct?
3081=     A    It is lower.
3082=     Q    I should also mention, the 13d_e map
3083=doesn't have the District 80 and 73 concerns you
3084=raised, correct?
3085=     A    I think that's correct.
3086=     Q    Because it holds District 80 and 73 the
3087=same as the enacted house map?
3088=     A    The 13 majority-minority are the same so
3089=it wouldn't.
3090=     Q    Correct.  And you also agree that all of
3091=the 13 series don't cross the Shelby County
3092=boundary?
3093=     A    That is correct.
3094=     Q    And it's your opinion that the enacted
3095=house map itself complies with the Voting Rights
3096=Act?
3097=     A    Chapter 598?
3098=     Q    Right.
3099=     A    Yes.
3100=     Q    So with the same 13 majority-minority
3101=districts, map 13d_e would similarly comply with the
3102=Voting Rights Act?
3103=     A    That would be the hope.
3104=     Q    Right.  And you didn't do as map drawer
fmt=pb
3105=Doug Himes an academic voting rights analysis for
3106=the whole map looking at racially polarized voting
3107=and the other facts in Gingles, correct?
3108=     A    As which Doug Himes?
3109=     Q    I don't think either Doug Himes did.
3110=     A    But you just said something Doug Himes.  I
3111=can't remember what you said.
3112=     Q    Did the map drawer Doug Himes do an
3113=academic voting rights analysis going through the
3114=Gingles factors, analyzing racially polarized voting
3115=and similar factors?
3116=     A    No, it didn't appear necessary.
3117=     Q    Okay.  And you ensured as enacted house
3118=map, just on its face, shows that it did not reduce
3119=the number of majority-minority districts from the
3120=previous decade?
3121=     A    It does not.
3122=          MR. TIFT:  I have been alerted that it's
3123=     about 12:30.  I don't know if we should take
3124=     our lunch break now and complete when we
3125=     return.
3126=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Let's come back at 1:40.
3127=                    [12:33 P.M., a recess was had
3128=                    until 1:41 P.M.]
3129=
3130=     Q    (By Mr. Tift) Mr. Himes, do you still have
fmt=pb
3131=a copy of the first Lockert case?  I don't remember
3132=if I brought it back.  It's 1982.
3133=     A    Lockert I?
3134=     Q    Yes, exactly.  Now, you agree that in
3135=Lockert 1, the Tennessee Supreme Court recognizes
3136=the importance of Tennessee counties as political
3137=units favored under the Tennessee Constitution,
3138=correct?
3139=     A    Yes.
3140=     Q    Okay.  And so, you acknowledge that the
3141=Supreme Court has recognized the importance of
3142=counties as political units and acknowledge that
3143=certain redistricting requirements honor that
3144=priority, correct?
3145=     A    Yes.
3146=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, just because we
3147=     had a break, I'm going to just renew the
3148=     standing objection to make sure it's preserved
3149=     on the record what the Tennessee Supreme Court
3150=     says is what the Tennessee Supreme Court says.
3151=     And Mr. Himes can't override that.
3152=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.  Noted for the
3153=     record.
3154=     Q    (By Mr. Tift) And you agree that
3155=redistricting decisions can impact voters'
fmt=pb
3156=substantive rights to vote in conformance with the
3157=Constitution, correct?
3158=     A    Correct.
3159=     Q    And if someone votes in a district that
3160=was drawn in violation of the Constitution, they
3161=would be denied the benefit of voting in a district
3162=that complies with the Tennessee Constitution,
3163=correct?
3164=          MR. RIEGER:  I would like to object, Your
3165=     Honor.  I'm not sure if we're talking about the
3166=     house map or the senate map.
3167=          MR. TIFT:  I was talking about a principle
3168=     of constitutional law, but if he doesn't know,
3169=     I mean...
3170=          THE WITNESS:  I would just say that I
3171=     don't think Lockert addresses what your
3172=     question is necessarily.
3173=     Q    (By Mr. Tift) Okay.  Now, you talked about
3174=at some point I think between your first days
3175=assisting then Representative Cohen or Senator
3176=Cohen, that you assisted him at maybe once a time
3177=before the new computer system had been purchased,
3178=or were you the first to help with the new computer
3179=system?
3180=     A    So back in the 1992 round, it was the
fmt=pb
3181=first time legal services had a computer system, but
3182=it was not Maptitude then.  I think the mainframe
3183=was a Sun system and it ran in Esri based, which is
3184=another GIS software.
3185=     Q    And you agree that having a computer
3186=system has allowed for much more precision in
3187=redistricting than beforehand when, I think you
3188=said, paper and crayons before?
3189=     A    Prior to the '90 round, it was big maps,
3190=markers and crayons on paper.
3191=     Q    So, would you agree that in the three
3192=redistrictings that you have done, as Maptitude has
3193=become more powerful, it has allowed you to become
3194=even more precise with your objectives?
3195=     A    It helps with redistricting, yes.
3196=     Q    Can I direct you to Exhibit 93.  And 93 is
3197=the house redistricting guidelines you and I looked
3198=at on Monday.  Do you recognize that?
3199=     A    I do.
3200=     Q    And you have testified that in addition to
3201=these six factors, you also consider core
3202=preservation and minimizing incumbent pairings as
3203=another two factors in the factors you are trying to
3204=balance, correct?
3205=     A    They are practices that go along with
fmt=pb
3206=these factors, correct.
3207=     Q    And they are not reflected in statute?
3208=     A    They are not.
3209=     Q    And earlier we were talking about map
3210=13d_e.  I believe I did not ask you about map
3211=13d_e's core retention.  You agree that map 13d_e
3212=retains approximately the same core percentage as
3213=the enacted house map, correct?
3214=     A    I don't recall exactly.  I think it's
3215=somewhere in one of these documents, but I would
3216=have to see that.
3217=     Q    And would you have any reason to disagree
3218=with Sean Trende, Defendants' other expert,
3219=concerning the fact that these two maps, enacted
3220=house map and 13d_e, preserve roughly the same
3221=percentage of cores?
3222=     A    If that is what he analyzed.  I suspect
3223=he's looked at -- I prefer to look at it myself to
3224=know where the cores were.  If I'm not mistaken, and
3225=maybe you can refer me to where a map is, but 13d_e
3226=does preserve some cores that -- well, I would have
3227=to look.  I'm sorry.
3228=     Q    And I'm just asking you, sitting here as
3229=an expert who has put in a report about all of these
3230=maps and subsequent affidavits about these maps, you
fmt=pb
3231=don't have any reason to disagree sitting here with
3232=Mr. Trende that the two maps preserve similar cores,
3233=correct?
3234=     A    If they have scored them some way that
3235=seems to be the same, I wouldn't disagree.
3236=     Q    And you also don't have any reason to
3237=disagree with Mr. Trende that the enacted house map
3238=and map 13d_e paired the same number of incumbents,
3239=correct?
3240=     A    Again, I would like to see if in the
3241=evaluation -- I'm not sure the evaluation I did for
3242=d_e had that.  And I wasn't here for Mr. Trende's
3243=testimony.  How many does it pair?
3244=     Q    Well, it sounds like from the information
3245=at your hands right now and at your mind, you're not
3246=sitting here testifying that 13d_e and the enacted
3247=house map pair different numbers of incumbents?
3248=     A    I don't recall.
3249=     Q    So now, let's look at the house
3250=redistricting guidelines.  You agree that map 13d_e,
3251=each district is a single-member district, correct?
3252=     A    Again, I have no reason to think that they
3253=are not, but it's been a while since I have looked
3254=at it, and I'm not looking at it currently.
3255=     Q    Okay.  I assume you would have put it on
fmt=pb
3256=your analysis if it didn't --
3257=     A    And I don't disagree with that.  I don't
3258=know where it is.
3259=     Q    All right.  Let's bring your analysis back
3260=up.  That's 89, includes your 13d_e analysis.
3261=     A    It has 99 single-member districts.
3262=     Q    Okay.  Great.  And you just agreed with us
3263=earlier that the districts comply with
3264=constitutional requirements for one person, one vote
3265=and are .01 percentage lower than the enacted house
3266=map, correct?
3267=     A    I agree, 9.89.
3268=     Q    Okay.  And you understand that map 13d_e,
3269=based on you pulling it into Maptitude is based on
3270=the 2020 census?
3271=     A    Yes.
3272=     Q    And you agree that once the three
3273=noncontiguities are corrected it is a contiguous
3274=map?
3275=     A    Yes.
3276=     Q    And you agree that certainly no more than
3277=30 counties were split to attach to counties or
3278=other parts of counties to form multicounty
3279=districts in map 13d_e, correct?
3280=     A    Correct.
fmt=pb
3281=     Q    And, in fact, 6 fewer than 30 were split
3282=at 24?
3283=     A    Fewer than 30.
3284=     Q    And you agree that map 13d_e complies with
3285=the Voting Rights Act in the same way as the enacted
3286=house map having the same 13 majority-minority
3287=districts?
3288=     A    Yes.
3289=     Q    And we just covered core preservation and
3290=incumbents based on how you answered.  So, just
3291=again, I would ask once the noncontiguities are
3292=corrected, you agree that 13d_e represents a
3293=constitutional map that splits fewer counties than
3294=the enacted house map and has a lower total
3295=deviation than the enacted house map, correct?
3296=     A    It does that.
3297=          MR. TIFT:  I'll pass the witness.

3300=REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. REIGER:
3301=     Q    Mr. Himes, in your Cross Examination, you
3302=and counsel spoke a great deal about the Lockert I
3303=decision.  Is that the only decision on
3304=redistricting in Tennessee?
3305=     A    No.
fmt=pb
3306=     Q    What are some of the others?
3307=     A    Lockert II, Lockert III, Lincoln County,
3308=Moore.  There are other ones, but those are probably
3309=the most relevant to county splitting.
3310=     Q    What is your understanding of Lockert II's
3311=guidance for urban counties?
3312=     A    My understanding from Lockert II is that
3313=the four urbans at the time, which were considered
3314=Shelby, Davidson, Knox, Hamilton, should not be
3315=divided but for two reasons, either to address a
3316=small deviation in an adjoining district or to
3317=prevent dilution of minority voting.
3318=     Q    Earlier you testified that you can reduce
3319=county splits by splitting urban counties; is that
3320=accurate?
3321=     A    I think I said it's in theory you would be
3322=able to do so.
3323=     Q    Is it your opinion that the portion of
3324=Lockert II that deals with urban county splits in
3325=conflict with the portion of Lockert I that says as
3326=few as possible?
3327=     A    I think that the decisions have some small
3328=inconsistencies in what they say and what the proof
3329=was in front of the Courts at the time.
3330=     Q    In Lockert II, did the Tennessee Supreme
fmt=pb
3331=Court compel the state to use the fewest number of
3332=county splits that the Chancery Court found?
3333=     A    No.
3334=     Q    Is that inconsistent with the language in
3335=Lockert I that Plaintiffs and you were speaking
3336=about earlier?
3337=     A    Yes.
3338=     Q    Okay.  Tell me about Lincoln County vs.
3339=Crowell.  What's your understanding of that case?
3340=     A    Lincoln County vs. Crowell was a challenge
3341=over a four-county area in southern, Middle
3342=Tennessee that involved two splits in the four
3343=counties.  And there seems to be in the language of
3344=the opinion that there was at least some proof that
3345=there was the ability to take those four counties
3346=and only split them one time, instead of the map at
3347=the time that split it twice.
3348=     Q    Applying Lockert I at face value, would
3349=that fly?
3350=     A    No.
3351=     Q    But the Tennessee Supreme Court did that
3352=in Lincoln County?
3353=     A    Yes.
3354=     Q    Can you tell me a little bit about your
3355=understanding of Moore vs. State?
fmt=pb
3356=     A    Moore vs. State again, and I don't work on
3357=senate plans, but it was a challenge to the senate
3358=plan after the 2012 redistricting cycle.  And I
3359=can't remember the exact number.  I believe it was
3360=eight counties that were split in the plan.  I think
3361=there was proof that there was at least one plan
3362=that may have had six.  And again, I may be a little
3363=bit off, but I know it was somewhere around there.
3364=     Q    During your discussion with Plaintiffs'
3365=counsel, you made the statement that core
3366=preservation is helpful with the deviation.  Now, I
3367=would like you to explain that just a little bit
3368=more if you could.
3369=     A    Well, I think in applying a one person,
3370=one vote standard and looking at even districts that
3371=are on the display, Cervas house d_e, we can use
3372=that, because it's the same to some extent as the
3373=enacted plan 598, Cheatham County is too small to be
3374=one district and maintaining part of Dickson County,
3375=which I believe it does go into Dickson County to
3376=make up that population, if you can make the
3377=districts work from an equal population standpoint
3378=and preserve a core of counties that are
3379=traditionally together and help you with being your
3380=overall deviation range, not only is it helpful from
fmt=pb
3381=a mapmaking purpose and from the county
3382=administration purpose, but it helps you create an
3383=overall plan based on something that has some, I
3384=guess, historical context.
3385=     Q    Did Plaintiffs have the opportunity to ask
3386=you about the relationship between your
3387=understanding of core preservation and your
3388=understanding of population equality?
3389=     A    I have been deposed two times.
3390=     Q    If we could go back to the big map of
3391=Chapter 598 and then Exhibit No. 103, which is the
3392=demonstrative that has the population totals for all
3393=the counties.
3394=     A    Okay.
3395=     Q    What is the population of Gibson County?
3396=     A    Gibson County's population is 50,429.
3397=     Q    Who surrounds Gibson County and what are
3398=their populations?
3399=     A    Crockett neighbors Gibson with a
3400=population of 13,391.
3401=     Q    If you were to attach Crockett to Gibson,
3402=could you avoid splitting Gibson, or would that fall
3403=below the acceptable total?
3404=     A    I don't have a calculator.  I would have
3405=to add this together and then also look at the
fmt=pb
3406=range.
3407=     Q    Would it surprise you if adding Gibson
3408=County and Crockett County together would fall
3409=underneath the acceptable district total?
3410=     A    It would not surprise me.
3411=     Q    Okay.  Look at Carroll County, Gibson
3412=County's neighbor.  What's the population of Carroll
3413=County?
3414=     A    It's 28,440.
3415=     Q    If you added Carroll to Gibson, could you
3416=avoid splitting either one of them?
3417=     A    It would be too high.
3418=     Q    Let's look at Madison County, another one
3419=of Gibson County's neighbors?
3420=     A    It has a population of 98,823, but it
3421=can't be combined with Gibson and comply with the
3422=Voting Rights Act.
3423=     Q    Let's look at Weakley County.  What is its
3424=population?
3425=     A    It would be too much.  Weakley is 32,902.
3426=     Q    How about Obion?
3427=     A    Obion would be too much, as well.
3428=     Q    What about Dyer?
3429=     A    Dyer would be too much, as well.
3430=     Q    So, is it fair to say that in combining
fmt=pb
3431=Gibson and any other county, one of them
3432=mathematically must be split?
3433=     A    Yes.
3434=     Q    When the Plaintiffs spoke to you about a
3435=9.96 deviation, do you recall that?
3436=     A    Yes.
3437=     Q    The clean side of 10 percent, the side
3438=that is not per se unconstitutional, would you agree
3439=is 9.99 percent?
3440=     A    Under 10 percent.
3441=     Q    Would you agree that that 9.96 percent is
3442=more than halfway to that bright line of per se
3443=unconstitutionality?
3444=     A    It is.
3445=     Q    Is 9.90 less of a litigation risk than
3446=9.96 in your opinion?
3447=     A    I believe it is.
3448=     Q    And I would like you to put on your expert
3449=hat one more time for one last group of questions
3450=and ask you what would be the consequences of
3451=requiring a perfect map?
3452=     A    I don't think -- the concept of a perfect
3453=map is -- I don't know if you could ever achieve it.
3454=Just looking at this cycle, and this cycle was
3455=unusual, but with only five months to draw
fmt=pb
3456=something, you would never know if you have done the
3457=best on every of the eight criteria and any of the
3458=eight criteria that the house uses.
3459=     Q    Would any map that was adopted be
3460=immediately challengeable if another map had one
3461=fewer county split, if that were the case?
3462=     A    I believe it could be, yes.
3463=     Q    Okay.  Is it your opinion as an expert
3464=that if perfection were required, Tennessee would
3465=potentially go through a decade-long cycle where its
3466=map was never not subject to challenge?
3467=     A    I think it's a possibility, yes.
3468=     Q    To your knowledge, has that ever happened
3469=in other states?
3470=     A    Yes.
3471=     Q    Can you explain that for us?
3472=     A    North Carolina is probably one of the best
3473=examples of decade's long litigation.  But I don't
3474=even have to go that far, because we at one time,
3475=Tennessee, redistricting was a decade's long process
3476=in the '80's round, in the '90's round.  In the
3477='90's round, plans A, B, and C, a plan that wasn't
3478=as compliant with the constitutional principles was
3479=in place until the final election of that
3480=redistricting cycle.  It wasn't until the 2000 round
fmt=pb
3481=that Plan B took effect.  So it's not hard to
3482=imagine the litigation risks.
3483=     Q    And is it your opinion as an expert that
3484=all of the county splits in Tennessee are based upon
3485=a federal justification?
3486=     A    Chapter 598 splits?
3487=     Q    Yes.
3488=     A    Yes.
3489=          MR. RIEGER:  No further questions.  Pass
3490=     the witness.

3493=
3494=RECROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. TIFT:
3495=     Q    Mr. Himes, you just testified that Gibson
3496=County or one of the counties around it, one of
3497=those has to be split, correct, based on population?
3498=     A    Yes, to combine with Gibson.
3499=     Q    And you agree it doesn't have to be
3500=Gibson?
3501=     A    Yes, that's correct.
3502=     Q    And I would ask you to look at two
3503=documents.  One is Exhibit 28, and that's going to
3504=be the 2010 house map?
3505=     A    Yes, Gibson is not split.
fmt=pb
3506=     Q    And they are in the same binders.  So you
3507=sort of hold that with one hand and flip back to
3508=Exhibit 10, Dr. Cervas' January 2023 report that has
3509=the illustration of 13d_e.
3510=     A    Yes.
3511=     Q    Now, if you look, 13d_e treats Gibson
3512=County and Carroll beside it to the naked eye quite
3513=similarly?
3514=     A    Yes.
3515=     Q    Gibson is whole.  Carroll is split.  And
3516=while I'm sure the line is not exactly the same,
3517=it's in a similar part of Carroll where the line is?
3518=     A    It's close, yes.
3519=     Q    That was District 79 before, correct?
3520=     A    It is and was, yes.
3521=     Q    Okay.  So you agree that 13d_e keeps
3522=Gibson whole and keeps 79 very similar to how it was
3523=before line wise?
3524=     A    It's very similar, yes.
3525=          MR. TIFT:  No other questions.
3526=          MR. RIEGER:  Just one or two more

3531=REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. REIGER:
3532=     Q    In the map you were just talking about,
3533=Carroll County is split because it's adjoined to
3534=Gibson County; is that accurate?
3535=     A    That is correct.
3536=     Q    In your mind, is that snapshot of those
3537=two counties in the enacted map, is that comparable
3538=to the issue that the Tennessee Supreme Court dealt
3539=with in Lincoln County vs. Crowell?
3540=     A    On the issue of splitting, although, I
3541=don't believe -- there may have been an allegation

3543=doesn't exist in 598.  But on the issue of the

3556=                    [Thereupon, a discussion off

3559=          MR. TIFT:  Your Honor, Plaintiffs will not
3560=     call any Redirect witnesses and therefore, I
3561=     would say, the proof is closed at this point.
3562=          Plaintiffs would like to move for directed
3563=     verdict.  I know where we are going on that,
3564=     but want to make the motion.
3565=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Go ahead.
3566=          MR. TIFT:  Your Honors, Plaintiffs move
3567=     for directed verdict at this point at the close
3568=     of all the proof for two reasons.  On the
3569=     senate side, the facts before the Court
3570=     demonstrate that Francie Hunt does, in fact,
3571=     have standing to bring her claim, and
3572=     Defendants have not demonstrated otherwise.
3573=          She is a voter in a nonconsecutively
3574=     numbered district.  She did vote in that
3575=     district.  She will vote in that district.  And
3576=     her constitutional right to vote in a
3577=     consecutively numbered district within a
3578=     fully-staggered deligation has been denied.
3579=          So we ask that that be ruled on a directed
3580=     verdict basis to save both the Court and
3581=     parties from having us take any longer, as the
fmt=pb
3582=     General Assembly is still in session to the
3583=     extent that the Court determines that that's
3584=     determinative at this point.  There's no reason
3585=     to delay while they are still in session.
3586=          On the house claim, Defendants bear the
3587=     burden, as the Court has said, of justifying
3588=     the enacted house map and showing that it
3589=     crosses as few county lines as necessary to
3590=     comply with federal constitutional
3591=     requirements.
3592=          As we know, Defendants have offered no
3593=     factual proof, because the only fact witness is
3594=     unable to testify due to a sustained privilege
3595=     on the facts underlying that case on that
3596=     claim.  And the Defendants' two expert
3597=     witnesses expressly disclaim any expert opinion
3598=     concerning whether the enacted house map, in
3599=     fact, crosses as few county lines as necessary
3600=     to comply with federal constitutional
3601=     requirements.
3602=          In addition, just now, Defendants' expert,
3603=     who previously opined, according to the text of
3604=     his report, that 7 of the 30 districts in the
3605=     enacted house map were not required by federal
3606=     constitutional requirements, now has agreed
fmt=pb
3607=     with Plaintiffs' expert that Plaintiffs' map
3608=     13d_e following noncontiguity corrections
3609=     represents a constitutional map with a lower
3610=     total variance and therefore better on one
3611=     person, one vote with the same 13
3612=     majority-minority districts and therefore
3613=     equivalent on Voting Rights Act and equal
3614=     protection requirements and with 6 fewer
3615=     splits, that being 20 percent fewer splits than
3616=     the enacted house map.
3617=          And Defendants other expert, though we do
3618=     not submit that either core protection or
3619=     incumbency can rise above the level of
3620=     constitutional requirements and justify a
3621=     split, 13d_e preserves the same degree of cores
3622=     and pairs the same number of incumbents
3623=     demonstrating that all state objectives could
3624=     have been met while honoring our Constitution's
3625=     requirement that no counties be split,
3626=     interpreted as, as few as possible for federal
3627=     reasons by our Supreme Court.
3628=          So, we would ask at this point, given the
3629=     failure of proof by Defendants on their burden
3630=     and the illustrative fact that, in fact, it's
3631=     not just an academic failure of proof, but that
fmt=pb
3632=     significantly fewer could have been divided,
3633=     that was Court rule in Plaintiffs' favor, and
3634=     that Plaintiffs submit a proposed order or that
3635=     we forego posttrial briefing, however the Court
3636=     chooses on that claim.
3637=          And finally, I would just note that in
3638=     Lockert II, the Plaintiffs would submit a close
3639=     reading of Lockert II would demonstrate that
3640=     the Chancery Court set a limit of 25 splits and
3641=     10 percent.  The Supreme Court didn't say,
3642=     yeah, that seems reasonable, but we'll give you
3643=     five more.  The Supreme Court says, based on
3644=     the facts in the record reviewed by this Court,
3645=     we find it unlikely that those metrics could be
3646=     met and increase the metric.
3647=          So, Lockert II doesn't stand for the
3648=     proposition that 25 is more or less the lowest,
3649=     but will give you five extras.  They examined
3650=     in detail the factual record and determined
3651=     that 25 and 10 percent were probably too low
3652=     and that realistic on the facts was 30 and more
3653=     or less 14 percent.  So, we wanted to address
3654=     that point.
3655=          So, we thank Your Honors for your time,
3656=     and ask for a motion directed verdict in favor
fmt=pb
3657=     of Plaintiffs.
3658=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.
3659=          MR. RIEGER:  Your Honor, Defendants
3660=     respond that a directed verdict as to
3661=     Plaintiffs' claims is appropriate in terms of
3662=     the denial of the senate claim, as we had
3663=     already moved forward had been denied.  But in
3664=     terms of granting either Plaintiffs' claims, we
3665=     contend that a directed verdict is not
3666=     appropriate.
3667=          A directed verdict is not appropriate for
3668=     the senate claim.  Proof in the record, as we
3669=     previously discussed, is straight-forward, and
3670=     it all comes from Ms. Hunt.  She has testified
3671=     that she was not denied the benefit of
3672=     staggered terms in the 2022 election.  That
3673=     means there's no harm.  That she has been
3674=     occasioned by the nonconsecutive numbering of
3675=     districts.  She then had to prove, because
3676=     there was no harm for standing purposes, that
3677=     it was imminent.
3678=          She testified that she was unaware of any
3679=     incumbents ever losing a primary.  She
3680=     testified that she was unaware of any
3681=     incumbents losing a general election.  And
fmt=pb
3682=     then, the Defendants put on proof in the
3683=     40-some-odd exhibits dealing with the election
3684=     results in Davidson County that the likelihood
3685=     of all three incumbents rolling over in the
3686=     next two cycles -- and again, it's only two
3687=     more cycles.  That's 2026 and 2030.  That the
3688=     possibly of one of those two instances, all
3689=     three incumbents rolling over, is practically
3690=     zero.
3691=          And if the Court needs to see that right
3692=     now in a very clearcut form, demonstrative
3693=     Exhibit 102, which we did not use today, but we
3694=     will feature prominently in our posttrial
3695=     brief, sets out the historical data as to why
3696=     Ms. Hunt is correct why she can't remember an
3697=     incumbent ever losing a general election or a
3698=     primary.  And it's because it does not happen.
3699=     It does not happen often.  It is very unlikely.
3700=     And for both to roll over at one time, it is
3701=     near impossible.
3702=          Because of that, because she has said that
3703=     she suffered no injury when she was not
3704=     deprived benefit of staggered terms in 2020's
3705=     election and because she has not demonstrated
3706=     imminence and the historical data undercuts any
fmt=pb
3707=     argument she could make, Plaintiffs are not
3708=     entitled to a directed verdict on the senate
3709=     claim and instead Defendants are.
3710=          As to the house claim, again, as we have
3711=     been arguing the entire time throughout the
3712=     initial TRO process, through summary judgment,
3713=     and now, the issue that we have is a standard.
3714=     And Plaintiffs latch onto Lockert I and close
3715=     their eyes to everything that the Tennessee
3716=     Supreme Court has done since 1982.  We know
3717=     that Lockert I -- Plaintiffs do quote it
3718=     correctly, as few splits as possible.
3719=          We know that Lockert II then has the
3720=     opportunity where it has a constitutional map
3721=     that is in front -- we have a finding by a
3722=     chancellor that it is possible and optimal to
3723=     have 25 splits and a 10 percent deviation.  And
3724=     the Tennessee Supreme Court says, we think you
3725=     can do it no more than 30 but needs to have a
3726=     justification.
3727=          Mr. Himes gave you his federal
3728=     justification.  Mr. Himes testified, and it was
3729=     not controverted, that core preservation is a
3730=     way and is inextricably intertwined with one
3731=     person, one vote.  You can use core
fmt=pb
3732=     preservation to help you determine which
3733=     counties you need to split in districts so that
3734=     way all of them include population equality as
3735=     a factor and a justification.
3736=          He testified that in his expert report in
3737=     that footnote, population equality is
3738=     underpinning all of those.  And that is a
3739=     sufficient federal constitutional
3740=     justification, because it means that those
3741=     county splits and the districts created therein
3742=     were designed to tackle population equality and
3743=     one person, one vote.
3744=          Now, Plaintiffs say that they win because
3745=     they have submitted what's arguably a better
3746=     map.  Again, Lockert II, it was 25; supreme
3747=     Court gave 30.  Plaintiffs say, well, if you do
3748=     a really close reading, which to us seems more
3749=     like a reading things that aren't there, you
3750=     can look ahead, because the problem actually
3751=     gets resolved in Lincoln County vs. Crowell.
3752=     Because there it's unequivocal that the Supreme
3753=     Court is presented with a map that splits less
3754=     districts compared to a map that splits more.
3755=          What did the Supreme Court do?  It
3756=     approved the map with more splits.  It said, we
fmt=pb
3757=     understand that you can split one less county
3758=     and not have to change anything else.  The
3759=     Supreme Court said, well, it's not
3760=     unconstitutional because it split more counties
3761=     than it should.
3762=          Here, Mr. Himes testified as to the
3763=     justifications.  His testimony was very
3764=     straightforward that he did not believe there
3765=     was a perfect map.  And what Plaintiffs are
3766=     inviting is a never-ending legal morass where
3767=     Tennessee will go decades, and their maps will
3768=     always be subject to challenge.
3769=          For example, Cervas house 13d, Dr. Cervas
3770=     today testified, you could draw a map as few as
3771=     22.  Well, that means that map is
3772=     unconstitutional.  What if we picked one of
3773=     Dr. Cervas' maps that he talked about today,
3774=     say 13c.  It has a higher deviation.  It goes
3775=     to 24.  Well, Dr. Cervas testified, you could
3776=     go down to 22.  So his map is unconstitutional.
3777=     And we would be doing that over and over and
3778=     over again.
3779=          And it doesn't make sense that Plaintiffs'
3780=     position that it has to be the fewest.  It
3781=     doesn't make sense because the Tennessee
fmt=pb
3782=     Supreme Court undercuts that.  It undercut it
3783=     Lincoln County vs. Crowell.  It undercut it in
3784=     Lockert II, and it undercut with the number of
3785=     counties compared to what the legislature was
3786=     allowed to use.  And it got undercut again in
3787=     Lockert II by how the Supreme Court ruled about
3788=     urban counties.
3789=          The testimony was very straightforward.
3790=     You can split fewer county if you can break
3791=     apart an urban county.  For instance, the high
3792=     5.09 percent number that we have been talking
3793=     about all day today, it causes the high because
3794=     we want to keep Montgomery County whole with
3795=     three districts in it.  That pushes it to 5.09.
3796=          If we could break that and get that down
3797=     maybe a percentage point by splitting that
3798=     county, then theoretically we could reduce the
3799=     deviation statewide.  The problem is that under
3800=     Lockert II's guidance, if it can be split in
3801=     and of itself and confined and split smaller to
3802=     help with the deviation, you can't do it
3803=     because it can stand alone.  And if Lockert I
3804=     [inaudible] as few county splits as possible,
3805=     then Lockert II wouldn't have said, you can't
3806=     split urban counties, because if you can split
fmt=pb
3807=     urban counties, you are in better compliance
3808=     with Lockert I.
3809=          Again, mapmaking is complex you have heard
3810=     that this year that the census and the lateness
3811=     was a problem.  They didn't have the data they
3812=     needed until August.  And Cervas had more than
3813=     a year before he finally came up with 13d_e.
3814=     Again, when you require protection, you have to
3815=     look at what the General Assembly has in front
3816=     of it at the time.
3817=          The General Assembly has a slew of very
3818=     unconstitutional maps and what was ultimately
3819=     passed as enacted plan 598.  Faulting the
3820=     General Assembly for not having or voting on
3821=     Cervas house 13d can't be used against it.
3822=     They did not get an opportunity to look at it.
3823=     It was never submitted.  Again, you can't hold
3824=     the General Assembly to a standard of
3825=     perfection redistricting because, as the
3826=     witnesses have testified, it's a
3827=     99-puzzle-piece puzzle with infinite solutions.
3828=          Here the legislature clearly had
3829=     justifications for each of its splits under
3830=     population equality and utilized its
3831=     redistricting guidelines, which it is permitted
fmt=pb
3832=     to do under Article 2, Section 4, to decide
3833=     what counties would be split to form which
3834=     districts to comply with one person, one vote
3835=     in those federal requirements.
3836=          That is the correct standard, and the
3837=     Court should not rely upon Plaintiffs' myopic
3838=     view that only Lockert I applies.  And for that
3839=     reason we would ask that Defendants be granted
3840=     a directed verdict and that Plaintiffs motion
3841=     for directed verdict should be denied.  Thank
3842=     you.
3843=          MR. TIFT:  Your Honors, Plaintiffs don't
3844=     now nor ever have argued that perfection is the
3845=     standard.  The standard is that the General
3846=     Assembly shall make a good-faith effort to
3847=     divide as few counties as necessary to comply
3848=     with the federal constitutional requirements.
3849=          Had they done so, it's clearly been
3850=     illustrated that they would have divided far
3851=     fewer.  Had they done so, they also presumably
3852=     would have created any record of having done
3853=     so, rather than create a public record of only
3854=     shooting for 30 and considering anything less a
3855=     policy decision and then shielding the rest of
3856=     the record from being part of the record
fmt=pb
3857=     through privilege.
3858=          We wouldn't be here if this was a question
3859=     of 30 versus 29.  And if it was a question of
3860=     30 versus 29 in the public hearings, the
3861=     General Assembly had laid out for the people
3862=     their process of determining that 30 was the
3863=     fewest they could get to for any reasonable
3864=     reason, but we are not here on that.
3865=          We are here looking at a significant
3866=     difference of 30 versus 6 or maybe even fewer
3867=     but at least six fewer in the face of no
3868=     evidence that the legislature actually made any
3869=     effort to follow the actual standard.
3870=          And as to Lincoln County, as we have
3871=     briefed, it is hugely important that Lincoln
3872=     County happened in the '80s after the Supreme
3873=     Court had said for the '80s, 30 splits seems to
3874=     comply, and two individual counties came back
3875=     challenging a map that already complied with
3876=     what the Supreme Court said was compliant.  The
3877=     Supreme Court then said, well, since they have
3878=     already met our 30-split threshold for this
3879=     year, we're not going to overturn an individual
3880=     county's line on a piecemeal attack without
3881=     some overwhelming evidence of bad faith.
fmt=pb
3882=          That was a year where the federal court
3883=     had also already approved the map that Lincoln
3884=     County and one other county decided to
3885=     challenge.  And so perfection is not the
3886=     standard.  The standard is, in fact, to make a
3887=     good-faith effort to divide as few counties as
3888=     possible to comply with federal constitutional
3889=     requirements.  And the evidence here
3890=     demonstrates that Defendants did not do so.
3891=          Finally, to return to the remedy, the
3892=     remedy we seek as required by state law is not
3893=     to pick any single map, to identify the
3894=     constitutional defects, and to provide the
3895=     legislature with an amount of time to be
3896=     determined by the Court to remedy those
3897=     defects.
3898=          Thank you, Your Honors.
3899=          MR. RIEGER:  If I can make just one brief
3900=     comment, and that is to remind the Court and
3901=     the parties that Moore vs. State was decided in
3902=     2014.
3903=          Thank you.
3904=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Thank you.  Anything else?
3905=          MR. TIFT:  Our housekeeping matters. I
3906=     think we were going to go through the exhibit
fmt=pb
3907=     list.  We are happy to do that with your clerk
3908=     if that would be preferable.
3909=          CHIEF JUDGE:  The Court respectfully
3910=     denies the motions by both sides, and this case
3911=     will proceed with posttrial briefs.
3912=          Do the parties have any schedule in mind
3913=     for filing those.
3914=          MR. RIEGER:  Our preference, if you are
3915=     okay with it, which we did in the 40-hour
3916=     waiting period trial, was 30 days but after we
3917=     get the transcripts.
3918=          MR. TIFT:  We would suggest shorter than
3919=     that in light of already approaching 2024
3920=     elections, that every passing week gets us
3921=     closer to that date.  At least, I would imagine
3922=     we could start drafting our briefs before we
3923=     have the record.  I would suggest two to three
3924=     weeks after receiving the transcripts.
3925=          MR. RIEGER:  We can meet you in the middle
3926=     and do three weeks.
3927=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Are the parties going to ask
3928=     for an expedited, or should I just not worry
3929=     about that?
3930=          MR. TIFT:  Expedited transcripts?
3931=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Yes.  I'm not pushing it.
fmt=pb
3932=     I'm just asking.  It might be a good idea.
3933=          MR. TIFT:  I would ask the court reporter
3934=     if they have a sense of timing.
3935=                    [Thereupon, a discussion off
3936=                    record was had.]
3937=
3938=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Why don't we go with 21 days
3939=     after the submission of the transcript.  And if
3940=     you would, put that in an order.
3941=          Also, I'll ask the lawyers if you would
3942=     briefly do an order that reflects the
3943=     evidentiary rulings we made earlier as to the
3944=     two motions heard on March 7th and the first
3945=     four Motion in Limine motions that we ruled
3946=     upon at the beginning of the trial.
3947=          Also, as to the exhibits, we want to make
3948=     sure that the ones that need to be marked for
3949=     identification purposes are marked accordingly
3950=     and the ones that have actually been admitted
3951=     are marked accordingly.  The way we do it is
3952=     that our court room deputy, Ms. Allen, marks
3953=     those exhibits.
3954=          I think that after the judges leave today,
3955=     you can work that out, or the lawyers can maybe
3956=     send a joint notice or something or communicate
3957=     with Ms. Allen.  I don't have a particular
fmt=pb
3958=     preference as how it's done as long as both
3959=     sides agree that these exhibits have been
3960=     admitted and these are for identification
3961=     purposes only.
3962=          And as to identification purposes only,
3963=     even if it's something like one of these big
3964=     charts that we hadn't talked about marking for
3965=     identification, if the parties agree on that,
3966=     we'll do it.  But don't do it unless there is
3967=     an agreement with those.  Does that sound
3968=     reasonable?
3969=          MR. TIFT:  Sounds great, Your Honor.
3970=          MR. RIEGER:  Yes, Your Honor.
3971=          MR. TIFT:  We'll work with your clerk and
3972=     then submit an order stating what's admitted,
3973=     what's identification.
3974=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Okay.  I think that will be
3975=     good, and the record will be clear on that.
3976=          MR. SWATLEY:  Your Honor, I apologize.  I
3977=     know we are at the very end here, but I did
3978=     just want to make brief note, when we began
3979=     this case, we had one more lawyer on our side,
3980=     Mr. John Ryder, who passed away last May during
3981=     the proceedings here.  He was a mentor and
3982=     friend to me, and I just wanted to mention
fmt=pb
3983=     during this trial that he was here and we wish
3984=     he was here today with us.
3985=          CHIEF JUDGE:  It is a loss to the Bar.
3986=          Anything else?
3987=          MR. RIEGER:  Not for Defendants, Your
3988=     Honor.
3989=          MR. TIFT:  Not for Plaintiffs.
3990=          CHIEF JUDGE:  Should we discuss the length
3991=     of the briefs?  As an anecdotal story, I had an
3992=     administrative appeal, and we were going to
3993=     have premiering briefs about a couple of years
3994=     ago.  And I'm expecting briefs about 40 pages,
3995=     and so I got 55 from one side and 80-something
3996=     from the other.  And for lawyers, that's not a
3997=     lot.  But if we could have some kind of idea.
3998=     Maybe we'll put a limit.
3999=          And again, as I indicated in our pretrial
4000=     conference, Russell Perkins prefers
4001=     freestanding brief.  I don't like to read five
4002=     briefs.  You are permitted to do it under local
4003=     rules, but I'd rather have a freestanding
4004=     brief, so if I'm home on the weekend, I can
4005=     just pull up one brief.
4006=          What do you say?
4007=          MR. TIFT:  Plaintiffs would suggest a
fmt=pb
4008=     30-page limit.
4009=          CHIEF JUDGE:  That's going to be hard.
4010=     Why don't we say 55 pages.
4011=          Does that work for you?
4012=          MR. RIEGER:  The State can accommodate
4013=     that, Your Honor.
4014=          MS. ALLEN:  All rise.  Court is adjourned.
4015=(2:29 P.M.)
4016=(Thereupon, the hearing was concluded.)
