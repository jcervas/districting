**ARKANSAS**

(Note: *Suttlar v. Thurston* was, in fact, about <u>racial
gerrymandering</u>, and not partisan gerrymandering. As to the
categorization of Arkansas as a partisan gerrymandering-litigation
state, the Brennan Center’s *Redistricting Litigation Roundup* noted a
separate <u>federal case</u>, *Simpson v. Hutchinson*, No. 4:22-CV-213
(E.D. Ark. Mar. 7 2022), which alleged partisan gerrymandering in
violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.)

-   *Suttlar v. Thurston*, No. 60CV-22-1849 (Ark. Cir. Ct. Pulaski Cty.
    Mar. 21, 2022).

    -   Plaintiffs Springer et al. filed a complaint alleging that the
        splitting of Pulaski County “interferes with and impairs the
        free exercise of suffrage by Black voters in Arkansas . . . by
        diluting, impairing, and undermining their ability to elect
        their candidates of choice.”

    -   Plaintiffs requested that the court “enter an Order declaring
        the 2021 Map unconstitutional; enjoining Defendants from any
        implementation of the 2021 Map; and compelling the adoption of a
        valid congressional map that does not unconstitutionally dilute
        Black voting power or target Black voters in deprivation of
        their rights guaranteed by the Arkansas Constitution.”

    -   Plaintiffs argue that the “2021 Map violates the Free and Equal
        Elections Clause of the Arkansas Constitution, which guarantees
        that ‘\[e\]lections shall be free and equal,’ and that ‘\[n\]o
        power, civil or military, shall ever interfere to prevent the
        free exercise of the right of suffrage; nor shall any law be
        enacted whereby such right shall be impaired or forfeited,’ Ark.
        Const. art. 3, § 2, as well as the Equal Protection Clause,
        which further guarantees that ‘\[t\]he equality of all persons
        before the law’ and ‘shall ever remain inviolate,’ id. art. 2, §
        3.”
