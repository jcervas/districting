<u>Case Briefing</u>

**<u>\[Miscellaneous Pending Cases: IL, NM\]</u>**

**ILLINOIS**

Note: Per the *All About Redistricting* webpage, there were three
redistricting cases in Illinois. However, each of those cases were
federal court challenges, which are beyond the scope of our review. For
informational purposes, the three cases were:

-   \(1\) *McConchie v. Illinois State Board of Elections*, No.
    1:21-CV-3091 (N.D. Ill. Jun. 9, 2021) (Republican legislative
    leaders),

-   \(2\) *United Congress of Community and Religious Organizations v.
    Illinois State Board of Elections*, No. 1:21-CV-5512 (N.D. Ill. Oct.
    15, 2021) (Black-led organizations), and

-   \(3\) *Contreras v. Illinois State Board of Elections*, No.
    1:21-CV-3139 (N.D. Ill. Jun. 10, 2021) (Latino voters and
    organizations).

-   The three cases were consolidated, and Plaintiffs challenged
    Illinois’ legislative redistricting map and asked the U.S. Dist. Ct.
    for the N.D. of Ill. to order alterations that would create
    additional districts featuring majorities of either Latino or Black
    voters.

    -   All Plaintiffs brought statutory claims, arguing that the
        redistricting map impermissibly diluted minority votes in
        violation of § 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 52 U.S.C. §
        10301, et seq.; the Contreras and East St. Louis NAACP
        Plaintiffs also presented constitutional claims, contending that
        several legislative districts were racially gerrymandered in
        violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.

-   On 12/30/2021, “a three-judge panel rejected all of the plaintiffs’
    claims that the most-recently drafted legislative maps are racially
    gerrymandered, finding that partisanship—rather than
    race—predominated in the configuration of the challenged districts
    and that plaintiffs did not otherwise establish a violation of
    Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.”[1]

    -   <u>The federal court then ruled that “\[o\]ur role as federal
        judges is limited and does not extend to complaints about
        excessive partisanship in the drawing of legislative
        districts.”</u>

    -   The deadline to appeal expired.

**NEW MEXICO**

-   *Republican Party of New Mexico* v. Oliver, No. D-506-CV-202200041
    (N.M. D. Ct. Jan. 21, 2022).

    -   Plaintiffs RPNM et al. filed a complaint alleging that “Senate
        Bill 1 . . . redraws New Mexico’s three congressional districts
        in contravention of traditional redistricting principles
        endorsed by the State Legislature and the New Mexico Supreme
        Court in order to accomplish a political gerrymander that
        unconstitutionally dilutes the votes of residents of
        southeastern New Mexico in order to achieve partisan advantage.”

    -   Plaintiffs requested, among other things, for final Judgment
        against Defendants, a declaration that Senate Bill 1 violates
        the New Mexico Constitution, and the adoption of a
        partisan-neutral congressional map consistent with Congressional
        Concept E (Justice Chávez’s map).

    -   Plaintiffs argued that SB1 is a political gerrymander in
        violation of Equal Protection, N.M. Const. art. II, § 18.
