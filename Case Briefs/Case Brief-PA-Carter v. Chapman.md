<li><p>The matter commenced on 12/17/2021, when two separate petitions
were filed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Carter Petitioners: Citizens registered to vote in PA.</p></li>
<li><p>Gressman Petitioners: Citizens registered to vote in PA and
“leading professors of mathematics and science[.]”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Petitioners claimed that the court’s congressional plan adopted
in <em>LWV III</em> in 2018 (using 2010 census data) violated their
state and federal rights to cast undiluted votes, because the 2018 Plan
divided the Commonwealth into 18 districts—the 2020 census data
reflected a population shift causing a loss of one congressional seat
(to 17), which rendered the 2018 Plan malapportioned.</p></li>
<li><p>On 12/20/2021, the court consolidated the petitions.</p></li>
<li><p>By order dated 1/14/2022, the court granted intervenor status to
a variety of petitioners, and required that each submit at least one
congressional plan and a supporting brief and/or expert report.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The court held hearings on 1/27 and 1/28, at which numerous
experts testified.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>By order dated 2/2/2022, the court granted the Carter
Petitioners’ Application for Extraordinary Relief, and, following
<em>Mellow v. Mitchell</em>, 607 A.2d 204 (Pa. 1992):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Designated a Special Master, the Hon. Patricia A. McCullough, who
presided over the matter when the court assumed plenary jurisdiction;
and</p></li>
<li><p>Directed the Special Master to file a report containing proposed
findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting her recommendation of
a districting plan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 2/7/2022, the Special Master submitted her report.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Special Master received 13 plans to study, yet chose the plan
created by the PA Legislature (H.B. 2146), which the Governor previously
vetoed on 1/26/2022.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>H.B. 2146 was given preferential treatment because “it is the
General Assembly’s prerogative, rather its constitutional mandate, to
redraw the state’s congressional districts. . . .”</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Various petitioners filed exceptions in the court challenging the
Special Master’s decision, and argument was heard on 2/18/2022.</p></li>

<td><strong>Rationale</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Court rejected the Special Master’s recommendation, focussing on
3 aspects of her analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) Partisan Advantage: Court rejected the Special Master’s
conclusion that certain plans improperly yielded a partisan advantage to
the Democratic Party contrary to Pennsylvania’s political geography.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While discounting 6 maps due to the absence of a sufficient
“Republican tilt,” the Special Master credited H.B. 2146 for the same
attribute, observing that the Republican majority in the General
Assembly “developed and proposed a plan, H.B. 2146, that favors
Democrats, which ultimately underscores the partisan fairness of the
plan.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ultimately, consideration of partisan fairness, when selecting a
plan among several that meet the traditional core criteria, is necessary
to ensure that a congressional plan is reflective of and responsive to
the partisan preferences of the Commonwealth’s voters.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(2) Population Deviation: Court rejected the Special Master’s
finding that certain plans failed to achieve a maximum population
deviation of one person.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While the districts in most of the plans deviated by only one
person, the two discounted plans deviated from the ideal district
population of 764,865 by plus one person or minus one person.</p></li>
<li><p>It was improper to discredit these two plans without considering
the reasons for the minor deviation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(3) Preferential Treatment of H.B. 2146: Court rejected the
Special Master’s preferential treatment of H.B. 2146.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To the extent that the Special Master’s recommendation was
premised upon bestowing H.B. 2146 preferential treatment simply because
it had made it partway through the legislative process, [the court]
reject[s] her endorsement of this plan on this basis alone.</p></li>
<li><p>This case is also distinguished from <em>Upham</em> which the
Special Master relied upon because here, the Governor vetoed the
plan.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Special Master improperly elevated the General Assembly’s role in
passing legislation over that of the Executive Branch, departing from
checks and balances.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Although the redistricting of congressional districts falls
squarely within the purview of the General Assembly, U.S. <span
class="smallcaps">Const</span>., art. I, § 4, cl. 1, the court had
“fulfilled [its] obligation to select a redistricting plan only because
the Legislature was unable to do so.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Having been thrust into the position of choosing a redistricting
plan due to the political stalemate between the Legislature and the
Governor, we applied the aforementioned designated criteria and
considerations and selected the Carter Plan.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The court did not select the Carter Plan because it utilized the
least change approach (although that was deemed a reasonable starting
point) but because the least change approach “worked in this case to
produce a map that satisfies the requisite traditional core criteria
while balancing the subordinate historical considerations and resulted
in a plan that is reflective of and responsive to the partisan
preferences of the Commonwealth’s voters.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The 17 districts are contiguous;</p></li>
<li><p>Although slightly less compact than other plans due to the plan’s
favorable consideration of existing political subdivisions (e.g.,
keeping Pittsburgh within a single district), such a reason is
sufficiently justifiable;</p></li>
<li><p>The plan was equipopulous, having a maximum deviation of two
persons, and satisfies the constitutional requirement of achieving equal
population “as nearly as is practicable.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Even if challenged in arguendo, the plan would be sufficiently
justified, because attempts to reach zero deviation required not only
the manipulation of several census blocks, but a split between Districts
3 and 5 in South Philadelphia.</p></li>
<li><p>The plan represents a good-faith effort, and the deviation was
solely to limit the number of splits.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>While the court did not opine as to which type of political
subdivision was preferable (i.e., county, city, incorporated town,
borough, township, or ward), the court merely observed that the Carter
Plan “was one of the best in terms of keeping counties whole and falls
within all other ranges of the plans submitted.”</p></li>
<li><p>Regarding subordinate historical considerations, the Carter Plan
sufficiently considered communities of interest, “lap[ped] the field” in
preserving prior districts, paid due consideration to incumbents (the
two incumbents paired in District 15 were necessitated by the population
shift), and was deemed fair based on various partisan fairness metrics
(e.g., Majority Responsiveness, Efficiency Gap, &amp;
Mean-Median).</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, while a VRA analysis was not performed, the existing 2
majority-minority districts were the same as in the 2018 Plan and had
not been challenged as violative of the VRA.</p></li>

tipped the scales in favor of the Carter Plan.”</p>

<li><p>The Carter Plan fails the <em>Karcher</em> test<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> by
providing for a two-person population deviation between the largest and
smallest congressional districts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“While I acknowledge that it is mathematically impossible to
create 17 districts of precisely equal population, it is possible, with
good faith, to craft a plan with less than a two-person deviation”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Only 2 out of the 13 maps proposed a deviation of more than one
person; the Carter petitioners also noted in their brief that they could
have created a plan with a one-person deviation.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike the <em>Mellow</em> Court, the majority has made no
attempt to evaluate whether the Carter Plan performs superiorly with
respect to splits of VTDs when compared to the 11 other plans that
achieved only a one-person deviation, but simply accepts that avoiding
the split of just one additional VTD constitutes a legitimate state
interest.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conversely, the Carter Plan also is the only plan that splits the
City of Williamsport--no legitimate state interest can be found in this
tradeoff.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Separately, the current matter before this Court, however, is not
a partisan gerrymandering case.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No one in this litigation has challenged any of the proposed
plans as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander under <em>LWV
II</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus, wading into the political thicket is “subjective, partisan,
and quintessentially political inquiry that belongs in the political
branches of our government, not in the courts.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>LWV II</em> should not embolden the court to choose the
“fairest map of them all.”</p></li>
<li><p>It would have been preferable to adopt the least-change approach
“instead of using unquestionably partisan constructs to justify its
selection. . . .”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“Where the judiciary is forced to adopt a legislative
reapportionment plan, the court should hew closely to nonpartisan
standards (e.g., compactness, contiguity, minimizing splits, etc.) or
nonpartisan methods (e.g., the “least-change” approach), eschewing
partisan considerations or partisan approaches.”</p></li>

<td><strong>Dissenting: Mundy, J.</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>As to the question of how to determine which of the proffered
maps best complies with the Constitution’s neutral factors after
eliminating any maps that fail to meet the constitutional floor, he
suggests considering two observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) the maps can be analogized to candidates in an election where
each criterion by which they are judged is the equivalent of an
individual voter taking part in a ranked-choice voting exercise;
and</p></li>
<li><p>(2) ranked-choice voting can be accomplished through pairwise
comparisons of the candidates, in this case, the candidate
maps.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>He would hold that this Court should rank and score all proposed
maps according to each of the individual quality metrics and select the
map with the highest total weighted score. The process entails five
steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) eliminate any map which fails to meet the constitutional
“floor” or which violates federal law; then as to each of the remaining
maps:</p></li>
<li><p>(2) compute raw scores for each map for each individual quality
metric using pairwise comparisons and Borda count;</p></li>
<li><p>(3) compute weighted scores for each map for each individual
quality metric by multiplying the raw scores by the weight for that
individual quality metric;</p></li>
<li><p>(4) compute the total weighted score for each map by summing all
weighted scores for that map; and</p></li>
<li><p>(5) select the map with the highest overall weighted
score.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Thus, with Dr. Duchin’s data the DRAW-LINES map was the top
scorer, with RESCH-1 as the runner-up.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As between those two maps, however, only RESCH-1 keeps Pittsburgh
whole, whereas DRAW-LINES splits it in two.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“I would conclude that the RESCH-1 map should be chosen
regardless of which data set is used.”</p></li>

the top of the pack.”</p></li>

to most closely adhere to those neutral standards.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The court need rarely to “look beyond the
constitutionally-specified neutral criteria” to assess the subordinate
considerations.</p></li>
<li><p>“In my view, assessment of subordinate or secondary
considerations such as partisan fairness, or whether a plan represents
the least change from a prior congressional districting plan, is
necessary <em>only</em> when a court must choose among various plans
that are equal with respect to their compliance with the core criteria.
Where, however, one plan is superior to all others, as measured by the
closeness of its adherence to these criteria, I find it unnecessary for
a court to consider the subordinate considerations.”</p></li>
