<u>Case Briefing</u>

**<u>\[Miscellaneous Pending Cases: AR, FL, KY, NM, OH, UT\]</u>**

**ARKANSAS**

(Note: *Suttlar v. Thurston* was, in fact, about <u>racial
gerrymandering</u>, and not partisan gerrymandering. As to the
categorization of Arkansas as a partisan gerrymandering-litigation
state, the Brennan Center’s *Redistricting Litigation Roundup* noted a
separate <u>federal case</u>, *Simpson v. Hutchinson*, No. 4:22-CV-213
(E.D. Ark. Mar. 7 2022), which alleged partisan gerrymandering in
violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.)

-   *Suttlar v. Thurston*, No. 60CV-22-1849 (Ark. Cir. Ct. Pulaski Cty.
    Mar. 21, 2022).

    -   Plaintiffs Springer et al. filed a complaint alleging that the
        splitting of Pulaski County “interferes with and impairs the
        free exercise of suffrage by Black voters in Arkansas . . . by
        diluting, impairing, and undermining their ability to elect
        their candidates of choice.”

    -   Plaintiffs requested that the court “enter an Order declaring
        the 2021 Map unconstitutional; enjoining Defendants from any
        implementation of the 2021 Map; and compelling the adoption of a
        valid congressional map that does not unconstitutionally dilute
        Black voting power or target Black voters in deprivation of
        their rights guaranteed by the Arkansas Constitution.”

    -   Plaintiffs argue that the “2021 Map violates the Free and Equal
        Elections Clause of the Arkansas Constitution, which guarantees
        that ‘\[e\]lections shall be free and equal,’ and that ‘\[n\]o
        power, civil or military, shall ever interfere to prevent the
        free exercise of the right of suffrage; nor shall any law be
        enacted whereby such right shall be impaired or forfeited,’ Ark.
        Const. art. 3, § 2, as well as the Equal Protection Clause,
        which further guarantees that ‘\[t\]he equality of all persons
        before the law’ and ‘shall ever remain inviolate,’ id. art. 2, §
        3.”

**FLORIDA**

-   *Black Voters Matter Capacity Building Inst., Inc. v. Lee*, No.
    2022-ca-000666 (Fla. Cir. Ct. Apr. 22, 2022).

    -   Plaintiffs BVM et al. filed a complaint alleging that Governor
        Ron DeSantis “hijacked” the redistricting process, by
        “unilaterally declar\[ing\] the Fair Districts Amendment
        unconstitutional” and by vetoing the Legislature’s congressional
        plan and “conven\[ing\] a special legislative session, leaving
        the Legislature little choice but to consider and pass his own
        redistricting scheme.”

        -   Plaintiffs also allege that the DeSantis Plan “intentionally
            favors the Republican Party at nearly every turn,
            eliminating three Democratic seats and transforming
            competitive seats into Republican-leaning ones. And in so
            doing, it needlessly produces noncompact districts that
            split geographic and political boundaries.”

    -   Plaintiffs requested that the court, among other things, declare
        that “the DeSantis Plan and/or individual districts in the
        DeSantis Plan violate Article III, Section 20 of the Florida
        Constitution,” enjoinment of the Defendants “from implementing
        enforcing, or giving any effect to the DeSantis Plan,” and an
        order or adoption of “a new congressional districting plan that
        complies with Article III, Section 20 of the Florida
        Constitution.”

    -   Plaintiffs argue that the DeSantis Plan violates Article III, §
        20 of the Fla. Constitution by diminishing minorities’ ability
        to elect, intentionally abridging and diminishing minority
        voting strength, intentionally favoring/disfavoring a political
        party, and violating traditional districting principles such as
        compactness, and political and geographical boundary splits.

**KENTUCKY**

-   *Graham v. Adams*, No. 22-CI-00047 (Ky. Cir. Ct. Jan. 20, 2022).

    -   Plaintiffs Graham et al. filed a complaint alleging that the Ky.
        General Assembly engaged in excessive county splitting and
        partisan gerrymandering.

    -   Plaintiffs requested that the court declare the maps
        unconstitutional in violation of Section 33 of the Ky.
        Constitution and sought “immediate injunctive relief to prevent
        the conduct of the May 2022 primary election based on the House
        districts created by HB 2 and Congressional districts created by
        SB 3, including any additional relief necessary to make such
        relief meaningful, such as the extension of filing deadlines for
        candidates seeking election in those districts.”

    -   Plaintiffs argued that (1) the “extreme partisan gerrymandering”
        of the maps, “violates Sections 1, 2, 3, and 6 of the Kentucky
        Constitution by arbitrarily denying the citizens of the
        Commonwealth the rights to a free and equal election, free
        expression, and free association”; and (2) that the “mapmakers’
        violat\[ed\] . . . Section 33 of the Kentucky Constitution by
        excessively and unnecessarily splitting counties into multiple
        districts without a legitimate purpose, and impermissibly
        attaching portions of split counties to others more times than
        is necessary to achieve districts of roughly equal size.”

    -   On 2/17/2022, the Franklin Cir. Ct. denied the Plaintiffs’
        motion for temporary injunction, citing that (1) the equities
        did not favor awarding a temporary injunction, (2) the status
        quo is the districts created by HB 2 and SB 3, (3) a temporary
        injunction will unjustly harm Secretary Adams and election
        officials, (4) a temporary injunction is not in the public’s
        interest, and (5) the Plaintiffs’ late filing of their
        injunction makes it irrelevant to consider whether Plaintiffs’
        presented a substantial question on the merits or whether they
        will suffer irreparable injury.

**NEW MEXICO**

-   *Republican Party of New Mexico* v. Oliver, No. D-506-CV-202200041
    (N.M. D. Ct. Jan. 21, 2022).

    -   Plaintiffs RPNM et al. filed a complaint alleging that “Senate
        Bill 1 . . . redraws New Mexico’s three congressional districts
        in contravention of traditional redistricting principles
        endorsed by the State Legislature and the New Mexico Supreme
        Court in order to accomplish a political gerrymander that
        unconstitutionally dilutes the votes of residents of
        southeastern New Mexico in order to achieve partisan advantage.”

    -   Plaintiffs requested, among other things, for final Judgment
        against Defendants, a declaration that Senate Bill 1 violates
        the New Mexico Constitution, and the adoption of a
        partisan-neutral congressional map consistent with Congressional
        Concept E (Justice Chávez’s map).

    -   Plaintiffs argued that SB1 is a political gerrymander in
        violation of Equal Protection, N.M. Const. art. II, § 18.

**OHIO**

-   *Adams v. DeWine*, No. 2021–1428 (Ohio Dec. 2, 2021).

    -   Plaintiffs Adams et al. filed a complaint alleging that the
        “General Assembly and the Governor blatantly disregarded that,
        in 2018, Ohioans voted three to one to amend the Ohio
        Constitution to eliminate the pernicious gerrymandering of
        Ohio’s congressional districts” by once again enacting “a rank
        partisan gerrymander—one that violates both the letter and the
        spirit of the 2018 reforms.”

    -   Plaintiffs requested that the court “declare that the
        apportionment plan adopted by Respondents . . . invalid for
        failure to comply with Article XIX of the Ohio Constitution”;
        issue a permanent injunction and judgment; hold hearings,
        consider briefing and evidence; and to retain jurisdiction of
        the action.

    -   Plaintiffs argued that 2021 Congressional Plan violated of
        Article XIX, Section 1(C)(3)(a) of the Ohio Constitution, which
        prohibits any plan “that unduly favors or disfavors a political
        party or its incumbents” and that the 2021 Congressional Plan
        violated Article XIX, Section 1(C)(3)(b) of the Ohio
        Constitution, which states that the “general assembly shall not
        unduly split governmental units, giving preference to keeping
        whole, in the order named, counties, then townships and
        municipal corporations.”

**UTAH**

-   *League of Women Voters of Utah v. Utah State Legislature*, No.
    220901712 (Utah D. Ct. Mar. 17, 2022).

    -   LWVU Plaintiffs et al. filed a complaint alleging that (1) the
        Utah Legislature’s 2021 Congressional Plan “violates multiple
        provisions of the Utah Constitution, including the Free
        Elections Clause, the Uniform Operation of Laws Clause,
        protections of free speech and association, and the right to
        vote; and (2) that “the Legislature’s repeal of Proposition 4
        \[a bipartisan citizen initiative that prohibited partisan
        gerrymandering\] violated the people’s constitutionally
        guaranteed lawmaking power and right to alter and reform their
        government.”

    -   Plaintiffs requested that the 2021 Congressional Plan be
        declared unconstitutional in violation of the Utah Constitution,
        to enjoin the Defendants from using the Plan, to compel
        Defendants to perform their redistricting duties in a manner
        that comports with the UT Constitution, to set a new deadline by
        which new maps would be due, to declare the 2020 repeal of
        Proposition 4 of the Utah Independent Redistricting Commission
        and Standards Act unconstitutional, and to retain jurisdiction.

    -   Plaintiffs argued that the Plan was a Partisan Gerrymander in
        Violation of the Utah Constitution’s:

        -   Free Elections Clause, Article I, Section 17;

        -   Equal Protection Rights, Article I, Sections 2 and 24;

        -   Free Speech & Association Rights — Article I, Sections 1 and
            15;

        -   Affirmative Right to Vote Protections — Article IV, Section
            2;

    -   Plaintiffs also argued that the unauthorized repeal of
        Proposition 4 was in violation of the Utah Constitution’s
        Citizen Lawmaking Authority to Alter or Reform Government,
        Article I, Section 2; Article VI, Section 1.
