<u>Case Briefing</u>


**FLORIDA**

-   *Black Voters Matter Capacity Building Inst., Inc. v. Lee*, No.
    2022-ca-000666 (Fla. Cir. Ct. Apr. 22, 2022).

    -   Plaintiffs BVM et al. filed a complaint alleging that Governor
        Ron DeSantis “hijacked” the redistricting process, by
        “unilaterally declar\[ing\] the Fair Districts Amendment
        unconstitutional” and by vetoing the Legislature’s congressional
        plan and “conven\[ing\] a special legislative session, leaving
        the Legislature little choice but to consider and pass his own
        redistricting scheme.”

        -   Plaintiffs also allege that the DeSantis Plan “intentionally
            favors the Republican Party at nearly every turn,
            eliminating three Democratic seats and transforming
            competitive seats into Republican-leaning ones. And in so
            doing, it needlessly produces noncompact districts that
            split geographic and political boundaries.”

    -   Plaintiffs requested that the court, among other things, declare
        that “the DeSantis Plan and/or individual districts in the
        DeSantis Plan violate Article III, Section 20 of the Florida
        Constitution,” enjoinment of the Defendants “from implementing
        enforcing, or giving any effect to the DeSantis Plan,” and an
        order or adoption of “a new congressional districting plan that
        complies with Article III, Section 20 of the Florida
        Constitution.”

    -   Plaintiffs argue that the DeSantis Plan violates Article III, §
        20 of the Fla. Constitution by diminishing minorities’ ability
        to elect, intentionally abridging and diminishing minority
        voting strength, intentionally favoring/disfavoring a political
        party, and violating traditional districting principles such as
        compactness, and political and geographical boundary splits.
