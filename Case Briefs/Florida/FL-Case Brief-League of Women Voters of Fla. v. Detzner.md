<td><strong>Procedural History</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>After the adoption of the Legislature's 2012 congressional
redistricting plan, two separate groups of plaintiffs filed civil
complaints, challenging the validity of the plan under new state
constitutional redistricting standards approved by the Florida voters in
2010 and now enumerated in article III, section 20, of the Florida
Constitution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Challengers argued that the Legislature cooperated and
collaborated with partisan political operatives aligned with the
Republican Party to produce a redistricting plan that was drawn in
contravention of article III, section 20, with the intent to favor
incumbents and the Republican Party, which was the controlling political
party in the Legislature at the time of the 2012 redistricting.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>After reviewing the evidence, the trial court found that the
Legislature's 2012 congressional redistricting plan was indeed drawn in
violation of the Florida Constitution's prohibition on partisan
intent.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>However, despite its finding of unconstitutional partisan intent,
the trial court invalidated only Districts 5 and 10, rejecting
challenges to seven other individual districts.</p></li>
<li><p>The trial court determined that there was no "distinction"
between a challenge to the plan as a whole and a challenge to specific
districts, and therefore "focused on those portions of the map" that it
found to be "in need of corrective action in order to bring the entire
plan into compliance with the constitution."</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The trial court applied a deferential standard of review in
analyzing each challenged district, "deferring to the Legislature's
decision to draw a district in a certain way, so long as that decision
does not violate the constitutional requirements."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>As a remedy, the challengers urged the trial court to adopt one
of their remedial plans, draw its own remedial plan, or hire an
independent expert to draw a remedial plan.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>After a hearing, the trial court declined the challengers'
suggestions and determined that the Legislature should redraw the
plan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Legislature held a special session in August 2014 to enact a
remedial redistricting plan.</p></li>
<li><p>The trial court approved the Legislature's remedial redistricting
plan and ordered the then-impending 2014 elections to proceed under the
unconstitutional 2012 plan due to time constraints, with the remedial
plan to take effect for the 2016 elections.</p></li>
<li><p>On appeal, the challengers sought affirmance of the trial court's
finding of unconstitutional partisan intent in drawing the state's
congressional districts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Their primary contention of error was that the trial court
applied an unduly deferential standard of review, thereby precluding it
from imposing a more meaningful remedy for its finding of
unconstitutional intent to favor the Republican Party and
incumbents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Legislature (respondents), while seeking affirmance of the
trial court's approval of the remedial redistricting plan, took issue
with the trial court's finding of unconstitutional intent,
specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) the trial court's finding of a connection between the
evidence and the Legislature itself, including the decision to ascribe
the intent of a few individuals to the Legislature as a collective body;
and</p></li>
<li><p>(2) even assuming the existence of unconstitutional intent, the
trial court's finding pertained solely to the two invalidated districts
and not to the broader process or map as a whole, therefore, any remedy
necessary had already been provided through the enactment of the
remedial redistricting plan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></td>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Disposition</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Affirmed the trial court's finding that the Legislature's enacted
map was "taint[ed]" by unconstitutional intent; however, reversed the
trial court's order upholding the Legislature's remedial redistricting
plan.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Case relinquished to the trial court for a period of 100 days
from the date of this opinion, with directions that it require the
Legislature to redraw, on an expedited basis, Congressional Districts 5,
13, 14, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, and all other districts affected by the
redrawing, pursuant to the guidelines set forth in this
opinion.</p></li>

<td><strong>Facts</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>The Fair Districts Amendment, added to the Florida Constitution
in 2010, sought to eliminate the age-old practice of partisan political
gerrymandering.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fla. citizens declared that the Legislature must "redistrict in a
manner that prohibits favoritism or discrimination." <em>Apportionment
I</em>, 83 So. 3d. at 632.</p></li>
<li><p>The Fair Districts Amendment was designed "to restore 'the core
principle of republican government,' namely, 'that the voters should
choose their representatives, not the other way around.'"</p></li>
<li><p>Based on the new constitutional standards that applied for the
first time to the 2012 process, transparency became legally significant
under the Florida Constitution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“[I]f evidence exists to demonstrate that there was an entirely
different, separate process that was undertaken contrary to the
transparent effort in an attempt to favor a political party or an
incumbent in violation of the Florida Constitution, clearly that would
be important evidence in support of the claim that the Legislature
thwarted the constitutional mandate." <em>Apportionment IV</em>, 132 So.
3d. at 149.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A month after the Florida voters approved the Fair Districts
Amendment during 11/2010 general election, then-Speaker of the House
Dean Cannon authorized a meeting in December 2010 at the headquarters of
the Republican Party of Florida, involving Republican political
consultants and legislative staffers, to discuss the upcoming
redistricting process.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At a second meeting the following month, in January 2011, the
consultants met with Senator Gaetz, Representative Weatherford, Alex
Kelly, and Kelly's Senate counterpart, John Guthrie.</p></li>
<li><p>These meetings were not open to the public and there is no record
of what was discussed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In 2/2012, "the Florida Legislature approved the decennial plan
apportioning Florida's twenty-seven congressional districts, based on
population data derived from the 2010 United States Census."</p></li>
<li><p>Even though the Republican consultants supposedly had no "seat at
the table," they continued to be involved in the process.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>After receiving maps from Cannon staffer Pepper, Reichelderfer
modified maps to increase the Republican performance of districts, and
he and the other consultants traded numerous maps back and forth with
each other.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Of significance, the trial court found that some of
Reichelderfer's modifications corresponded to the actual decisions the
Legislature ultimately made.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The consultants also had no need to publicly participate in order
to influence the Legislature's redistricting plan—throughout the
process, Reichelderfer was in direct contact with Speaker
Cannon.</p></li>
<li><p>Communications among the consultants also revealed particular
emphasis on certain areas of the map and districts.</p></li>
<li><p>And, many final revisions that affected numerous districts in
some way—such as the decision to push the Black Voting Age Population
(BVAP) of District 5 over 50%, add an appendage to District 10, split
Homestead, and increase the Hispanic Voting Age Population (HVAP) of
Districts 9 and 14—were made in a non-public meeting that occurred after
the House and Senate had each passed their versions of the congressional
map.</p></li>

<li><p>With "fairness" as its "focus," the Fair Districts Amendment
"expressly prohibits" redistricting "practices that had been acceptable

favor a political party or an incumbent."</p></li>

<li><p>Importantly, however, "Florida's constitutional provision
prohibits intent, not effect," which is to say that a map that has the

lawmakers, the trial court failed to give proper legal effect to its

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Rationale</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p><strong>The "Intent" Inquiry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Following this Court's precedent, which "emphasize[s] that this
case is wholly unlike the traditional lawsuit challenging a statutory
enactment," the trial court framed the "intent" inquiry as determining
"the motive in drawing" the districts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We agree that this was the correct approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Under this framework, the trial court appropriately concluded
that "the actions and statements of legislators and staff, especially
those directly involved in the map drawing process[,] would be relevant
on the issue of intent." [i.e., no legislative privilege.]</p></li>
<li><p>Case law supports the trial court's conclusion that the intent of
individual legislators and legislative staff members involved in the
drawing of the redistricting plan is relevant in evaluating legislative
intent.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Legal Sufficiency of the Trial Court's Finding of
Unconstitutional Intent</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>At the threshold, the court’s review of the trial court's finding
takes place against the backdrop that the Legislature "systematically
deleted almost all of their e-mails and other documentation relating to
redistricting."</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Legislature did so despite knowledge that litigation over the
constitutionality of its redistricting plan was inevitable.</p></li>
<li><p>The Legislature saved virtually no communications among
legislators and staff and none of the communications—which, as a result
of this case, we now know to have occurred involving the outside
political consultants.</p></li>
<li><p>Even in the absence of a legal duty, the spoliation of evidence
results in an adverse inference against the party that discarded or
destroyed the evidence—the trial court was, therefore, justified in
drawing an adverse inference against the Legislature in adjudicating the
challengers' claim of unconstitutional partisan intent.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Collectively, the evidence that the challengers were able to
uncover after a protracted discovery process demonstrates a different
scenario than the entirely open and transparent process touted by the
Legislature when this Court considered the original apportionment
challenges to the state Senate and House maps in <em>Apportionment
I</em>, specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Legislature's destruction of "almost all" emails and "other
documentation relating to redistricting";</p></li>
<li><p>early meetings between legislative leaders and staff with
political consultants regarding the "redistricting process";
and</p></li>
<li><p>the "continued involvement" of political consultants in the
"redistricting process."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>While the trial court did find the professional staff to be
"credible" and not to have been "part of the conspiracy," the trial
court immediately dismissed the Legislature's argument about the effect
of the staff having been insulated from the improper intent . . . by
stating that the "political operatives managed to find other avenues,
other ways to infiltrate and influence the Legislature, to obtain the
necessary cooperation and collaboration" to "taint the redistricting
process and the resulting map with improper partisan intent."</p></li>
<li><p>There is also no doubt that the trial court's finding of
unconstitutional intent pertained to the "process" of redistricting and
the "enacted map" as a whole rather than solely to the two specifically
invalidated districts as the Legislature contends.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>None of the evidence relied upon by the trial court was
district-specific.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Trial Court’s First Legal Error: Failing to Properly
Analyze the Challenge to the Plan “As a Whole.”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Trial court erred in its determination that there was no
distinction between a challenge to the redistricting plan "as a whole"
and a challenge to individual districts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This error led to the trial court's failure to give any
independent legal significance to its finding of unconstitutional intent
when examining the challenges to individual districts (trial court
stated, “What would be the point [in redrawing the entire map] if the
other districts are otherwise in compliance?”).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The trial court's decision to invalidate Districts 5 and 10 were
improperly based solely on blatant tier-two violations (i.e.,
compactness and utilization of political and geographical boundaries
where feasible, etc.), instead of finding that the whole plan was
unconstitutional because of improper intent in the whole plan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Trial Court’s Second Legal Error: Applying a Deferential
Standard of Review.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Once the trial court found unconstitutional intent, there was no
longer any basis to apply a deferential standard of review; instead, the
trial court should have shifted the burden to the Legislature to justify
its decisions in drawing the congressional district lines.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The trial court erred when it began its inquiry by asking whether
there was any tier-two violation, and only then considering the direct
and circumstantial evidence of tier-one improper intent as "additional
evidence" to "strengthen or weaken" an "inference of improper intent"
that was identifiable from tier-two deficiencies.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The trial court did so despite finding that the direct and
circumstantial evidence itself had established a violation of the
tier-one constitutional standards.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The evidence of improper intent in this case, unlike in
<em>Apportionment I</em>, involved direct and circumstantial evidence of
tier-one violations of the constitutional intent standard—in
<em>Apportionment I</em>, the court relied on tier-two violations
because it lacked a factually-intensive record with which to determine
improper intent in the first instance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Court’s Decision on the Legal Effect of Finding
Unconstitutional Intent.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rather than foster additional delay and risk another election
under unconstitutional districts, we have all the record evidence
necessary to evaluate now whether the Legislature's justifications can
withstand legal scrutiny.</p></li>
<li><p>District 5: concluded that, because the trial court found that
District 5 was a key component of the Legislature's unconstitutional
intent in the drawing of the congressional redistricting plan, the trial
court erred in conducting only a cursory review of the remedial district
and deferring to the Legislature's North-South configuration on the
basis of unstated "non-partisan policy reasons."</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Since the Legislature cannot prove that the North-South
configuration is necessary to avoid diminishing the ability of black
voters to elect a candidate of their choice, we hold that District 5
must be redrawn in an East-West manner.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Districts 13 &amp; 14: concluded that the trial court erred in
rejecting the challenge to these districts, and they must be redrawn to
avoid crossing Tampa Bay.</p></li>
<li><p>Districts 26 &amp; 27: concluded that the trial court erred in
rejecting the challenge to these districts, and they must be redrawn to
avoid splitting Homestead.</p></li>
<li><p>District 25: concluded that the district must be redrawn to avoid
splitting Hendry County.</p></li>
<li><p>Districts 21 &amp; 22: left it for the Legislature to determine
how to redraw these two districts.</p></li>

<td><ul>
<li><p>The circuit court properly ruled that the appellants failed to
establish any basis for requiring the Legislature to further revise
Florida's congressional district map.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The majority's decision to reverse the circuit court and to
invalidate numerous districts in the remedial congressional district
plan adopted by the Legislature involves an extreme distortion of the
appellate process deployed to effect a serious violation of the
separation of powers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>There was no finding whatsoever that the Legislature acted with
improper intent regarding the entire congressional plan or that the
"whole plan" challenge had been proven.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The majority puts forth a misconstruction of the trial court's
ruling based on fragments from the final judgment taken out of context
and creatively cobbled together.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The upshot is a virtually revolutionary deformation of the
appellate process.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>While the consultants "managed to taint the redistricting process
and the resulting map with improper partisan intent,” the consultants'
conspiracy was not successful in affecting the entire map drawing
process.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The trial court determined that "the staff members who did the
bulk of the actual map drawing for the Legislature . . . were not a part
of the conspiracy, nor directly aware of it, and that significant
efforts were made by them and their bosses to insulate them from direct
partisan influence."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>With respect to two districts, the trial court found that the
districts were drawn with unconstitutional intent; with respect to the
other districts, the trial court found that the appellants had failed to
establish that the districts were drawn with unconstitutional
intent.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Under the majority's application of the presumption of
unconstitutionality, an alternative suggested by the challengers is
virtually guaranteed to trump any choice made by the Legislature.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This vividly illustrates just how far the majority has gone in
repudiating the principle that a redistricting plan should not be
declared unconstitutional "unless it clearly appears beyond all
reasonable doubt that, under any rational view that may be taken of the
[plan], it is in positive conflict with some identified or designated
provision of constitutional law."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>With the invalidation of Remedial District 5 and other challenged
districts, the ironic result is that districts drawn by professional
committee staff, who were insulated from partisan influence in the
drawing of the districts, are effectively displaced by districts drawn .
. . under the auspices of the National Democratic Redistricting Trust in
cooperation with the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee.</p></li>
<li><p>By imposing its own judgment about the factual inferences to be
drawn from the evidence at trial, the majority has transgressed the
boundaries of proper appellate review and invaded the province of the
trier of fact.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Having invaded the province of the trier of fact to find the
factual basis for triggering the newly created presumption of
unconstitutionality, the majority continues its march to dominate the
redistricting process and finishes the job—at least for now—by making
the factual determinations that the Legislature did not prove a lack of
improper intent in the drawing of the specifically challenged
districts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Marching forward, the majority eviscerates numerous factual
determinations made by the trial court in its evaluation of the
individual district challenges.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The majority caps off its abandonment of the restraints of the
appellate process by retaining jurisdiction after deciding this case,
dictating the details of the proceedings in the trial court, and
presuming to require that all filings submitted in the trial court shall
"simultaneously be submitted to this court."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The damage done by this decision to the structure of the
appellate process is exceeded only by the damage done to the
constitutional separation of powers. Injury to the separation of powers
in this case takes two forms.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, the majority effectively supplants the substantive
constitutional power of the Legislature to draw congressional
districts.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, the majority invades the internal workings of the
Legislature by effectively dictating how the Legislature must conduct
its business in connection with the adoption of the revised
congressional redistricting plan that the majority has
mandated.</p></li>
