<td><strong>Procedural History</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Shortly after the adoption of Sub. SB 355 (SB 355), plaintiffs
sued in state court to enjoin the use of SB 355 in the upcoming
elections.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Rivera Plaintiffs and the Alonzo Plaintiffs alleged that SB
355 was a partisan and racial gerrymander, diluting minority votes in
violation of several provisions of the Kansas Constitution.</p></li>
<li><p>Two weeks later, the Frick Plaintiffs sued alleging that SB 355
was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>After denying the Defendants’ petition for mandamus and quo
warranto, the court consolidated the three cases in Wyandotte
County.</p></li>
<li><p>On 4/25/2022, the district court held that SB 355 violated the
Kansas Constitution as both a partisan and a racial gerrymander.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Alongside photographs of legislators looking at their phones
during their listening tours, the district court stated that Ad Astra 2
was created in secret and "pushed through the Legislature" on "largely
party-line votes" and "with no Democratic support."</p></li>
<li><p>The court further stated that "the map split known communities of
interest, ignored public input, diluted minority votes, and constituted
'textbook gerrymandering.'"</p></li>
<li><p>The court found that "Ad Astra 2 was designed intentionally and
effectively to maximize Republican advantage," relying on expert
testimony to conclude that the plan "[was] an intentional, effective
partisan gerrymander.”</p></li>
<li><p>The district court permanently enjoined KS’ election officials
"from preparing for or administering any primary or general
congressional election under Ad Astra 2,” and it further ordered that
the "Legislature shall enact a remedial plan in conformity with this
opinion as expeditiously as possible."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The State immediately appealed to the KS Supreme Court.</p></li>

<td><strong>Facts</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>In 2021, the KS Legislature began the process of preparing to
redraw KS’ four congressional districts according to the 2020
Census.</p></li>
<li><p>Subsequently, the Legislature's bipartisan Redistricting Advisory
Group adopted the Guidelines<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and the Senate and House
Redistricting Committees received presentations on the Guidelines at
initial meetings in January 2022.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>However, only the House Committee on Redistricting adopted the
Guidelines—the Senate Committee on Redistricting did not; and, neither
the House nor the Senate as a whole adopted the Guidelines.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 1/20/2022, SB 355 was introduced in the Senate, and referred
to the Committee on Redistricting.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On 1/21/2022, several proposed amendments to the plan introduced
on the Senate floor were rejected, and the Senate passed SB 355 on by a
vote of 26 to 9.</p></li>
<li><p>The bill was sent to the House on 1/24/2022, passed the House
Redistricting Committee, and reached the House floor on
1/25/2022.</p></li>
<li><p>After several motions to amend were rejected, the House passed
the bill by a vote of 79 to 37.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>SB 355 was then enrolled and presented to Governor Kelly on
1/27/2022.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Governor Kelly vetoed the bill on 2/4/2022, and, initially, the
motion to override the veto failed, and the veto was sustained.</p></li>
<li><p>However, upon a motion to reconsider, the Senate voted to
override the veto 27 to 11, and the House 85 to 37.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Subsequently, SB 355 took effect upon publication in the Kansas
Register on 2/10/2022.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="smallcaps">Kan. Const.</span> Bill of Rights, §
2.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"All political power is inherent in the people, and all free
governments are founded on their authority, and are instituted for their
equal protection and benefit. No special privileges or immunities shall
ever be granted by the legislature, which may not be altered, revoked or
repealed by the same body; and this power shall be exercised by no other
tribunal or agency."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Political Question Doctrine</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The "political question doctrine excludes from judicial review
those controversies which revolve around policy choices and value
determinations" that are inextricable from the exercise of political
discretion vested in the political branches of government. 16 C.J.S.
Constitutional Law § 392.</p></li>

"judicially discoverable and manageable standards.”</p></li>

<li><p>(1) Court held “that until such a time as the Legislature or the
people of Kansas choose to follow other states down the road of limiting
partisanship in the legislative process of drawing district lines,
neither the Kansas Constitution, state statutes, nor our existing body
of caselaw supply judicially discoverable and manageable standards ‘for
making such judgments, let alone limited and precise standards that are
clear, manageable, and politically neutral[,]” and therefore the
question presented was nonjusticiable as a political question.</p></li>
<li><p>(2) Court held that plaintiffs did not establish the elements of
their race-based claims and therefore could not show that Ad Astra 2
discriminated against minority voters.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Rationale</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Court found that it had jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs’ claims,
rejecting AG’s independent state legislature theory.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The U.S. Supreme Court has never embraced this view of the
Elections Clause, and, in recent years, the Supreme Court has continued
to reject similar arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>Court “cannot accept the Attorney General's invitation to ground
our rulings on speculation concerning the future direction of Supreme
Court jurisprudence. Instead, we are bound to follow United States
Supreme Court precedent on questions of federal law.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Any line drawing, even one that violates equal protection
guarantees,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> does not infringe on a standalone
right to vote, the right to free speech, or the right to peaceful
assembly.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"[T]here are no restrictions on speech, association, or any other
First Amendment activities in the districting plans at issue. The
plaintiffs are free to engage in those activities no matter what the
effect of a plan may be on their district." <em>Rucho</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>"The fundamental right to vote on equal terms simply means that
each vote should have the same weight. . . . [P]artisan gerrymandering
has no significant impact upon the right to vote on equal terms under
the one-person, one-vote standard. . . . Partisan gerrymandering plainly
does not place any restriction upon the espousal of a particular
viewpoint." <em>Harper v. Hall</em> (Newby, C.J., dissenting).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Legislature is constitutionally permitted to consider
partisanship when drawing district lines, consistent with longstanding
United States Supreme Court precedent.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The district court cannot write [this] hard truth[] out of
existence with the fiat power of its judicial pen.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Claims of excessive partisan gerrymandering are nonjusticiable in
Kansas, because the question then becomes a political one: “how much is
too much?”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Without codified law to guide judges in knowing when too much
partisanship becomes so unfair as to offend constitutional principles,
the question cannot be answered.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“There are no legal standards discernible in the Constitution for
making such judgments, let alone limited and precise standards that are
clear, manageable, and politically neutral. Any judicial decision on
what is 'fair' in this context would be an 'unmoored determination' of
the sort characteristic of a political question beyond the competence of
the federal courts.” <em>Rucho</em>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“Unlike in Florida and other of our sister states that have
codified limits on partisan gerrymandering, in Kansas the answer (for
now) must be no” as to the justiciability issue.<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because KS has not adopted such standards, it “cannot follow the
decisions of other state supreme courts . . . that have found their
states to be within the <em>Rucho</em> exception of states with
‘statutes and . . . constitutions’ that ‘provide standards and guidance
for state courts to apply.’”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Although plaintiffs have proposed a variety of different metrics
for measuring "fairness" and answering the "how much is too much"
question, . . . none of these metrics have a foundation in Kansas
law—either statutory enactment or constitutional text.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Further, those metrics “assume too much” by presuming to
understand what “fairness” is. <em>Id.</em> at 185–86.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“In the absence of statutory or constitutional standards in
Kansas . . . plaintiffs point to the substantive content of the
Guidelines and ask us to find standards of ‘fairness’ there. But as
already mentioned, the Legislature has never adopted the
Guidelines.”</p></li>

<li><p>Alonzo Plaintiffs</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Argued that Ad Astra 2:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) violates Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights sections 1 and 2
"because it targets [plaintiffs] for differential treatment based upon
their political beliefs and past votes";</p></li>
<li><p>(2) violates sections 3 and 11 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of
Rights because it "discriminates against Kansas Democrats based on their
protected political views and past votes, burdens the ability of those
voters to effectively associate, and retaliates against Democrats for
exercising political speech" by preventing "them from being able to
coalesce their votes and elect their preferred candidates who share
their political views";</p></li>
<li><p>(3) "imposes a severe burden" on plaintiffs' right to vote under
Article 5, section 1 by "targeting Democratic voters to prevent them
from translating their votes into victories at the ballot box";
and</p></li>
<li><p>(4) violates equal protection guarantees in sections 1 and 2 of
the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights because it was "created
specifically to eliminate the only seat currently held by a

<td><strong>Concurring in Part, Dissenting in Part: Rosen,
J.</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>“The dominant political party in our Legislature recently
reapportioned Kansas congressional districts in such a manner as to
dilute—or eliminate—the voting rights of racial minorities as well as to
propel this state's national political power toward a monolithic
single-party system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The majority of our court today gives its stamp of approval to
this assault on the democratic system and the constitutional backbone of
our democracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Because I cannot countenance the subversion of the democratic
process to create a one-party system of government in this state and to
suppress the collective voice of tens of thousands of voters, I
dissent.”</p></li>
<li><p>“As the Legislature has distorted and contorted the political map
in order to monopolize the position of one political party, the majority
opinion distorts and contorts legal reasoning and constitutional theory
to uphold racial discrimination and political chicanery.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“Early in its opinion, the majority quickly and matter-of-factly
pronounces that ‘the equal protection guarantees found in section 2 are
coextensive with the equal protection guarantees afforded under the
Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.’ With these few
taps on a keyboard, the majority denies Kansans the very thing our
founders envisioned: a people's government that fervently guards the
people's equal benefit from and access to the law. . . .”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first thing about section 2's text that the majority ignores
is the most obvious: it is different from the text in the Fourteenth
Amendment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This—"[a]ll political power is inherent in the people, and all
free governments are founded on their authority, and are instituted for
their equal protection and benefit"—is not the same as this—"No state
shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws."</p></li>
<li><p>One is a positive conferral of rights; the other is framed in the
negative.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Kansas also ratified its Section 2 in 1859, nine years before the
ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment; the historical origins and
context also make it plain that the declarations have separate
meanings.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“I would have . . . concluded that [Section 2] is a rich and
generous declaration that guarantees the people of Kansas protections
that are broader than those found in the federal Equal Protection
Clause. This reflection would support the legal framework and conclusion
my dissenting colleagues present today: Ad Astra 2's invidious
discrimination against people based on past political speech and race
<u>certainly presents a justiciable question</u> and clearly violates
the protections enshrined in the Kansas Constitution [emphasis
added].”</p></li>

<td><strong>Concurring in Part, Dissenting in Part: Biles, J., joined by
Rosen and Standridge, J.J.</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>These circumstances cry out for judicial review.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The district court's factual findings lay bare how this "Ad Astra
2" legislation intentionally targets fellow Kansans because of their
voting history, their prior expression of political views, their
political affiliations, and the color of their skin.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“I can't abide by the majority's decision to look the other way
by invoking the political question doctrine for the first time in this
context. And when I apply the legal analysis to the established facts, I
don't like what I see. I also would apply a state-based analysis to the
race-based claims under the Kansas Constitution. I would affirm the
district court although my rationale differs in a few places.”</p></li>
<li><p>It is important to appreciate the judicial bait-and-switch that
has happened.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, the U.S. Supreme Court held in a recent 5-4 decision that
federal courts must avoid partisan gerrymandering claims from the
various states. <em>Rucho</em>. But in doing so, the Court's majority
noted state courts were still available to stand guard against
constitutional mischief.</p></li>
<li><p>Plaintiffs here dutifully followed <em>Rucho</em>'s prompt and
brought their case against Ad Astra 2 to state court, even though
federal court is where these issues had been heard in our state over the
past several decades.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, the majority slams the courthouse door shut by declaring:
"[W]e can discern no judicially manageable standards by which to judge a
claim that the Legislature relied too heavily on the otherwise lawful
factor of partisanship when drawing [congressional] district
lines."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If these issues were political questions without manageable
judicial standards, why would our court so consistently have bothered to
even acknowledge its concern about partisan gerrymandering over so many
prior decades?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The majority remains silent about that, but the answer is obvious
from the caselaw. Our court has had no difficulty seeing its job as
protecting constitutional rights when redistricting comes around beyond
just doing the population math. (Dissent cites various cases where the
judiciary intervened. <em>Id.</em> at 206–07.)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“The majority cannot square its retreat on this issue with our
court's nine reapportionment cases since 1963.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The answer to the majority's question of how much is too much is
straightforward: partisan gerrymandering is "too much" when partisanship
motivated the state action in question when there is no other legitimate
rationale driving the outcome.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Viewed in this manner, our court's role is confined not to
determining the best policy, but to deciding whether the Legislature's
discretionary decisions can be explained by a lawful government
aim.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The District Court did not “go rogue.” It adopted a traditional
equal protection framework firmly founded in our caselaw—triggered by
its initial determination that the questioned state action, i.e., Ad
Astra 2's enactment, resulted from the intentional targeting of
constitutionally protected activities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The district court concluded "the Kansas Constitution's equal
protection, free speech and assembly, and suffrage provisions provide
manageable standards to adjudicate partisan gerrymandering
claims."</p></li>
<li><p>It further noted, "The key provisions here—involving equality,
free speech, and suffrage—have long been the basis of litigation in
state courts, from which Kansas courts can draw and provide manageable
standards."</p></li>
<li><p>And the court added, "[W]hile federal courts may be unable to
hear partisan gerrymandering claims under the federal Constitution, the
Kansas Constitution allows this [state] Court to hear those
claims."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“In updating district lines, the levers of government were not
operated to achieve permissible ends, even with some tolerance for
incidental, political benefits. And lacking an appropriate government
interest to justify its effects, Ad Astra 2 deprives Kansans the equal
protection of the laws of this state.”</p></li>

racial vote dilution was excluded, as beyond the scope of our
review.]</p></li>
