<u>Case Briefing</u>


**KENTUCKY**

-   *Graham v. Adams*, No. 22-CI-00047 (Ky. Cir. Ct. Jan. 20, 2022).

    -   Plaintiffs Graham et al. filed a complaint alleging that the Ky.
        General Assembly engaged in excessive county splitting and
        partisan gerrymandering.

    -   Plaintiffs requested that the court declare the maps
        unconstitutional in violation of Section 33 of the Ky.
        Constitution and sought “immediate injunctive relief to prevent
        the conduct of the May 2022 primary election based on the House
        districts created by HB 2 and Congressional districts created by
        SB 3, including any additional relief necessary to make such
        relief meaningful, such as the extension of filing deadlines for
        candidates seeking election in those districts.”

    -   Plaintiffs argued that (1) the “extreme partisan gerrymandering”
        of the maps, “violates Sections 1, 2, 3, and 6 of the Kentucky
        Constitution by arbitrarily denying the citizens of the
        Commonwealth the rights to a free and equal election, free
        expression, and free association”; and (2) that the “mapmakers’
        violat\[ed\] . . . Section 33 of the Kentucky Constitution by
        excessively and unnecessarily splitting counties into multiple
        districts without a legitimate purpose, and impermissibly
        attaching portions of split counties to others more times than
        is necessary to achieve districts of roughly equal size.”

    -   On 2/17/2022, the Franklin Cir. Ct. denied the Plaintiffs’
        motion for temporary injunction, citing that (1) the equities
        did not favor awarding a temporary injunction, (2) the status
        quo is the districts created by HB 2 and SB 3, (3) a temporary
        injunction will unjustly harm Secretary Adams and election
        officials, (4) a temporary injunction is not in the public’s
        interest, and (5) the Plaintiffs’ late filing of their
        injunction makes it irrelevant to consider whether Plaintiffs’
        presented a substantial question on the merits or whether they
        will suffer irreparable injury.
