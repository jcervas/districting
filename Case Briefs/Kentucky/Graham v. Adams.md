<td><strong>Procedural History</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>On 1/20/2022, Plaintiffs initiated this action against Secretary
of State Michael G. Adams (“Secretary Adams”) and the Kentucky State
Board of Elections (“the SBE”) to challenge the constitutionality of HB
2 and SB 3.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>With respect to HB 2, Plaintiffs allege that HB 2 violates
Sections 1, 2, 3, 6, and 33 of the Kentucky Constitution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plaintiffs state that HB 2 is the result of extreme partisan
gerrymandering, which they believe is prohibited under Sections 1, 2, 3,
and 6 of the KY Constitution.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, Plaintiffs contend that HB 2 violates Section 33 of
the KY Constitution because it excessively splits counties more times
than necessary.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>With respect to SB 3, Plaintiffs assert that it also is the
result of extreme partisan gerrymandering and violates Sections 1, 2, 3,
and 6 of the KY Constitution.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 1/27/2022, the Commonwealth of KY, by and through Attorney
General Daniel Cameron (“the Commonwealth”), moved to intervene to
defend the constitutionality of HB 2 and SB 3.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Commonwealth’s Motion to Intervene was orally granted and
entered on 2/10/2022.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 1/28/2022, Plaintiffs moved for injunctive relief to enjoin
the use of HB 2 and SB 3 in the 2022 election cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On 2/4/2022, the Commonwealth filed a crossclaim and
counterclaim, challenging the constitutionality of the prior 2012/2013
districts and asking the court to permanently enjoin the use of those
apportionment plans in any future election.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, on 2/4/2022, the Commonwealth and Secretary Adams
jointly filed a Motion to Dismiss.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 2/10/2022, the Court heard oral argument.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>By Order entered 2/17/2022, the Court denied the Commonwealth’s
and Secretary Adams’ Motion to Dismiss finding that it was
premature.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, by separate Order entered 2/17/2022, the Court
denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Injunction.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Court determined that “injunctive relief would disrupt the
status quo, would unduly harm Secretary Adams and other election
officials, and would disserve the public.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A bench trial was held on 4/5–4/7/2022.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At trial, Plaintiffs offered 10 exhibits into evidence and the
Commonwealth offered 35 exhibits.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, Plaintiffs proffered expert testimony from 2
witnesses: Dr. Kosuke Imai<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and Dr. Devin Caughey,<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and lay testimony from three 3
witnesses: Representative Derrick Graham, Jill Robinson, and Trey
Heineman (<em>see</em> lay testimony at pp. 18–24).</p></li>
<li><p>In rebuttal, the Commonwealth proffered expert testimony from 2
witnesses: Sean Trende<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> and Dr. Stephen Voss.<a href="#fn5"

<td><strong>The Rule(s)</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Standing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>Sexton</em> Court adopted the <em>Lujan</em> test and
clarified that “for a party to sue in Kentucky, the initiating party
must have the requisite constitutional standing to do so, defined by
three requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) injury,</p></li>
<li><p>(2) causation, and</p></li>
<li><p>(3) redressability.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Associational Standing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At the federal level, the United States Supreme Court has
established three requirements that must be met to demonstrate
associational standing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own
right;</p></li>
<li><p>(2) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the
organization’s purpose; and</p></li>
<li><p>(3) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires
the participation of the individual members in the lawsuit.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(Note: Although the Kentucky Supreme Court had not formally
adopted the second and third prongs of the federal test for
associational standing, because the Kentucky Democratic Party had met
the first element for associational standing, the Court felt compelled
to assess whether the Kentucky Democratic Party met the remaining
elements, and determined that they had done so.)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Presumed Constitutionality of Acts of the General Assembly</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Acts of the General Assembly are given a “strong presumption of
constitutionality.”</p></li>
<li><p>A party challenging a duly enacted statute by the General
Assembly is faced with the burden of proving the challenged act
unconstitutional.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In order to declare an act unconstitutional, the constitutional
violation “must be clear, complete and unmistakable.”</p></li>
<li><p>The Court is bound to resolve “any doubt in favor of
constitutionality rather than unconstitutionality.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><span class="smallcaps">Ky. Const.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>§1</strong> – Free Speech/Disfavored Status Based on
Political Affiliations</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provides that all Kentuckians shall have the inalienable rights
of “freely communicating their thoughts and opinions” and “assembling
together in a peaceable manner for their common good, and of applying to
those invested with the power of government for redress of grievances or
other proper purposes, by petition, address or remonstrance. . .
.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>§2</strong> – Arbitrary Exercise of Power</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Absolute and arbitrary power over the lives, liberty and
property of freemen exists nowhere in a republic, not even in the
largest majority.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>§3</strong> – Equal Protection</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All men, when they form a social compact, are equal; and no grant
of exclusive, separate public emoluments or privileges shall be made to
any man or set of men, except in consideration of public services; but
no property shall be exempt from taxation except as provided in this
Constitution, and every grant of a franchise, privilege or exemption,
shall remain subject to revocation, alteration or amendment.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>§6</strong> – Free Elections</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“All elections shall be free and equal.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>§33</strong> – Population Equality and County
Integrity</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first General Assembly after the adoption of this
Constitution shall divide the State into thirty-eight Senatorial
Districts, and one hundred Representative Districts, as nearly equal in
population as may be without dividing any county, except where a county
may include more than one district, which districts shall constitute the
Senatorial and Representative Districts for ten years. Not more than two
counties shall be joined together to form a Representative District:
Provided, In doing so the principle requiring every district to be as
nearly equal in population as may be shall not be violated. At the
expiration of that time, the General Assembly shall then, and every ten
years thereafter, redistrict the State according to this rule, and for
the purposes expressed in this section. If, in making said district,
inequality of population should be unavoidable, any advantage resulting
therefrom shall be given to the district having the largest territory.
No part of a county shall be added to another county to make a district,
and the counties forming a district shall be contiguous.</p></li>

HB 2 and SB 3 violate Sections 1, 2, 3, 6, or 33 of the Kentucky
Constitution, because the Kentucky Constitution does not expressly
prohibit partisan gerrymandering and does not require the General
Assembly to minimize the number of times that the required split
counties are further divided.</p></li>
</ul></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Rationale</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p><strong>Plaintiffs’ claims are justiciable.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The judiciary has the ultimate power, and the duty, to apply,
interpret, define, construe all words, phrases, sentences and sections
of the Kentucky Constitution as necessitated by the controversies before
it.</p></li>
<li><p>Well over a century ago, Kentucky’s highest court rejected the
general idea that redistricting is a political question not within the
bounds of judicial review. <em>Ragland v. Anderson</em>, 100 S.W. 865,
867 (Ky. 1907).</p></li>
<li><p>As recently as the last round of redistricting in 2012, the
Kentucky Supreme Court reaffirmed the judiciary’s duty to “‘ascertain
whether a particular redistricting plan passes constitutional muster
[.]’” <em>Legislative Research Comm’n v. Fischer</em>, 366 S.W.3d 905,
911 (Ky. 2012).</p></li>
<li><p>“[T]he judiciary will never force the General Assembly to adopt a
specific redistricting plan, but if an enacted redistricting plan
violates a constitutional mandate, it is the judiciary’s ‘constitutional
responsibility . . . to tell them what is the constitutional “minimum.”
’ ”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Plaintiffs have standing to challenge HB 2 and SB 3.
<em>See id.</em> at 26–38.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are over one hundred years of cases that support
challenging an apportionment plan as a citizen, taxpayer, and voter and
pleading a constitutional violation caused by the apportionment plan
establishes the requisite injury to satisfy standing. <em>See Ragland v.
Anderson</em>, 100 S.W. 865 (Ky. 1907); <em>Stiglitz v. Schardien</em>,
40 S.W.2d 315 (Ky. 1931).</p></li>
<li><p>“It is not merely the right of the citizen under the Constitution
to be fairly represented in the government, but also his right to
prevent unequal and unconstitutional discrimination against his own
favor of other districts, that enables the court to intervene. Every
citizen, taxpayer, and voter has an undoubted right to have the
districts for representatives and senators created in accordance with
the Constitution . . . The rights of the whole state are linked up with
the representation of the several districts.” <em>Stiglitz</em>, 40
S.W.2d at 317–18.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>HB 2 is a Partisan Gerrymander.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, Dr. Imai testified that HB 2 is a partisan
gerrymander.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>After comparing HB 2 to 10,000 simulated plans, and ordering the
districts based on Democratic vote share, his analysis showed that HB 2
is an outlier.</p></li>
<li><p>He also confirmed that under HB 2, Democratic electors in
Jefferson and Fayette Counties have been cracked and packed to create
additional Republican safe districts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Second, Dr. Caughey’s and Dr. Voss’s analyses of Kentucky’s
Efficiency Gap demonstrate that although Kentucky should expect a higher
Efficiency Gap given its political geography, under HB 2, the Efficiency
Gap is significantly higher.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dr. Imai’s work concludes that HB 2’s partisan skew is not due to
Kentucky’s political geography, but due to the cracking and packing of
Democratic electors in districts to allow Republicans to maximize
partisan gains statewide.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Third, after evaluating HB 2’s Declination, Dr. Caughey testified
that HB 2’s Declination is “off the charts,” and shows a pro-Republican
bias larger than he has ever seen.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>SB 3 is a Partisan Gerrymander.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Evidence presented at trial sufficiently demonstrates that SB 3
is a partisan gerrymander.</p></li>
<li><p>The Court finds Dr. Imai’s testimony extremely reliable and gives
it significant weight.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dr. Imai’s simulations found that SB 3’s First District is less
compact than 99% of simulated plans that contain Franklin
County.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Imai criticized freezing a previously enacted district
because freezing a district has a direct impact on the compactness of
surrounding districts.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Imai also testified that the Democratic vote share in SB 3’s
First District is 35%, which is an extreme outlier.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Commonwealth’s experts failed to rebut Dr. Imai’s
findings.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mr. Trende failed to offer any explanation for the uncompact
First District besides his belief that the Second District must remain
gridlocked for William Natcher; his testimony oddly focused on
“freezing” the Second District in political consideration of a man who
passed away in March 1994 and has not represented the Second District
for almost thirty years.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In solely focusing on preserving the memory of William Natcher,
Mr. Trende gave no consideration to Kentucky’s remaining five (5)
districts, which share equal importance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mr. Trende also opined on “rules” that the General Assembly has
when drawing maps but could not cite to any “rules” and admitted that he
had not consulted with any members of the General Assembly, so he did
not know what criteria or “rules” they used when drawing SB 3.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>His “rule” testimony mainly focused on preserving “historical
pairings,” clearly to support his belief that the Second District must
remain as is forever.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Court finds Mr. Trende’s testimony self-serving and
unreliable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Commonwealth’s other expert witness, Dr. Voss, actually
supported Dr. Imai’s testimony.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dr. Voss testified that when the algorithm is instructed to keep
Warren, Daviess, and Bullitt Counties together, rather than gridlocking
the entire Second District, Franklin County does not end up in the First
District.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Voss also disagreed with Mr. Trende’s obsession with freezing
the Second District “for historical reasons” and said that rooting an
analysis too deeply in past precedent and failing to give way to legal
requirements and guidelines is an error.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Notwithstanding, the Kentucky Constitution does not
expressly prohibit partisan gerrymandering.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Section 33 Claim, Population Equality and County
Integrity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Since <em>Fischer II</em>’s release in 1992, the “dual mandate”
of population equality and county integrity has held strong.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Kentucky Supreme Court has continued to uphold or strike down
House redistricting plans solely based on whether the plan (1) splits
the minimum number of counties required and (2) keeps a population
variation between +/- 5%.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Turning back to <em>Jensen</em>, the Kentucky Supreme Court
specifically held that the General Assembly is not constitutionally
prohibited from dividing the minimum number of counties multiple
times.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>Jensen</em> Court emphasized that “[t]here is a
difference between what is perceived to be unfair and what is
unconstitutional” and “[a]pportionment is primarily a political and
legislative process.”</p></li>
<li><p>Thus, the <em>Jensen</em> Court held that under Section 33 of the
Kentucky Constitution there is no prohibition against partisan
gerrymandering or excessively dividing the split counties.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Court must evaluate HB 2 under the standard set for Section
33 challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>HB 2 divides exactly 23 counties (the minimum number of counties
that must be divided) and each district is within the +/- 5% range of
the required 45,058 people.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Although Plaintiffs have demonstrated that HB 2 is a partisan
gerrymander and that HB 2 excessively splits the 23 counties more times
than necessary, Kentucky Supreme Court precedent, in this Court’s eyes,
does not prohibit such.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Section 6 Claim, Free Elections</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Section 6 has no analogue in the federal Constitution, which
signals it was crafted to ensure greater protection for Kentuckians.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Other states’ constitutions have similar provisions to Kentucky’s
Section 6 that have recently been used to hold partisan gerrymandering
unconstitutional.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This Court, however, must examine Kentucky precedent and the
1890-91 constitutional debates to find support for Plaintiffs’ claim
that Section 6 prohibits partisan gerrymandering.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Framers, concerned that others might struggle to ascertain
the exact meaning of the simple phrase “[a]ll elections shall be free
and equal,” discussed the adoption of the phrase from the English
Declaration of Rights.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“They did not mean that all persons should have a vote, or that
no registration should be required. They meant simply that no troops
should intimidate voters.” <em>1890-91 Debates</em> at 670.</p></li>
<li><p>The consensus continued to be that Section 6 be enacted to
prohibit election day interferences at polling places that had disgraced
English history and had even made way to our great
Commonwealth.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Kentucky precedent consistently supports that Section 6 has
nothing to do with apportionment, but rather prohibition against
interferences with the vote-placement and vote-counting
process.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Court understands that partisan gerrymandering challenges
have been sweeping the nation and that Plaintiffs want this Court to
look at and rely upon decisions made by other states’ high courts, but
this Court is only concerned with the Kentucky Constitution and what is
permitted under it.</u></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Accordingly, the Court declines to address the validity or
applicability of other states’ partisan gerrymandering decisions in this
action because the Court finds that the 1890-91 constitutional debates,
coupled with Section 6 precedent authored by Kentucky’s high courts,
satisfactorily lead the Court to conclude that Section 6 of the Kentucky
Constitution does not prohibit partisan gerrymandering because it does
not apply to apportionment, but rather to interferences with the
vote-placement and vote-counting process.</p></li>
<li><p>Plaintiffs do not present a viable claim under Section 6 that HB
2 or SB 3 are unconstitutional because Plaintiffs have not alleged that
HB 2 or SB 3 interfere with the vote-placement or vote-counting
process.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Equal Protection Claims, Sections 1, 2, and
3.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Court concludes Plaintiffs have failed to raise a viable
equal protection claim.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Kentucky law supports that an equal protection claim can be
raised for population or race inequality and Plaintiffs have not alleged
such an equal protection violation for HB 2 or SB 3.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“[V]ote dilution” to trigger an equal protection claim occurs
only when the one-person, one-vote rule is not respected or when racial
gerrymandering occurs.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead, Plaintiffs have only raised an unrecognized equal
protection violation of partisan gerrymandering, and, as the Court has
opined, <u>Kentucky law has never recognized such a claim and there is
no judicially manageable standard to measure a partisan gerrymandering
claim</u>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Kentucky Constitution is silent as to the consideration of
partisan interests in apportionment, which leads the Court to conclude
that such consideration is not prohibited, otherwise, apportionment
would not have been assigned to the General Assembly—a political
body—but rather to a politically neutral committee.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Plaintiffs do not challenge that the population variation of
these districts is unconstitutional, and Plaintiffs have not alleged
that SB 3 is a racial gerrymander; therefore, HB 2 and SB 3 do not
violate the Kentucky Constitution’s guarantee of equal
protection.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Section I Claim, Free Speech/Disfavored Status Based on
Political Affiliation.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Court appreciates the opinion issued by the North Carolina
Supreme Court [of which Plaintiffs heavily rely], but that opinion was
based on the North Carolina Constitution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Again, the Court must base its findings on the Kentucky
Constitution and Kentucky has long recognized that Section 33 of the
Kentucky Constitution controls apportionment of state legislative
districts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Kentucky Constitution assigned the duty of apportionment to
the General Assembly—a partisan body.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Section 33 does not contain a requirement of political neutrality
for redistricting, nor does any other section of the Kentucky
Constitution.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Kentucky Supreme Court has recognized that “[a]pportionment
is primarily a political and legislative process,” which seemingly
defeats any claim that partisan considerations in redistricting are
prohibited.</p></li>
<li><p>Accordingly, the Court must reject Plaintiffs’ Section 1
claim.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Section II Claim, Unconstitutional Arbitrary Exercise of
Power.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>As the Court has noted throughout its analysis of HB 2 and SB 3,
there is no doubt that HB 2 and SB 3 are partisan gerrymanders,
<em>but</em> the Court must recognize that the Kentucky Constitution
instills the power of apportionment in the hands of the General
Assembly—a political body.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Kentucky Constitution does not explicitly forbid the
consideration of partisan interests in apportioning
representation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Because HB 2 complies with Section 33 of the Kentucky
Constitution, which provides explicit direction for apportioning state
legislative districts, the Court holds that HB 2 does not violate
Section 2 of the Kentucky Constitution because it is not arbitrary.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Similarly, because SB 3 meets the requirements of population and
racial equality, the Court holds that SB 3 does not violate Section 2 of
the Kentucky Constitution.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Court holds that Section 2 of the Kentucky Constitution is not a
mechanism to render unconstitutional legitimate exercises of the General
Assembly that are perceived as unfair.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Court respects the Kentucky Constitution’s strong separation
of powers and given the lack of obvious unconstitutionality to HB 2 and
SB 3, the Court will not overstep the explicit role given to the
judiciary in assessing the constitutionality of an apportionment scheme
by delving into legislative motive.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Commonwealth’s crossclaim and counterclaim is rendered
moot.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Court holds that the Commonwealth is not entitled to judgment on
its crossclaim and counterclaim because, given the holding in this
Opinion and Order [affirming the constitutionality of HB 2 and SB 3],
the Commonwealth’s crossclaim and counterclaim is moot as it pertains to
the relief sought, is not otherwise independently ripe for review, and
this Court does not issue advisory opinions.</p></li>

2012/2013 districts plainly shows that the 2012/2013 districts violate
provisions of both the Kentucky Constitution and the United States
Constitution.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Plaintiffs</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contend that HB 2 repeatedly violates Section 33 of the Kentucky
Constitution because it disrupts Section 33’s dual mandate of achieving
approximate population equality while maintaining county integrity.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plaintiffs believe that Section 33 requires the General Assembly
to multi-split counties as few times as possible to maintain county
integrity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Alleged that because HB 2 and SB 3 are partisan gerrymanders, the
apportionment plans violate Sections 1, 2, 3, and 6 of the Kentucky
Constitution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Partisan gerrymandering creates the same harm as malapportionment
by giving certain electors’ votes more power than others.</p></li>
<li><p>Partisan gerrymandering violates the guarantee of equal
protection because drawing districts based on partisan affiliation
denies certain electors equal voting power and dilutes their votes,
preventing them from aggregating their votes to elect a desired
representative.</p></li>
<li><p>Partisan gerrymandering targets certain electors and subjects
them to disfavored status based on their political affiliation and
voting history.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plaintiffs thus allege that partisan gerrymandering violates free
speech and association protected by Section 1 of the Kentucky
Constitution.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Partisan gerrymanders that were crafted by the General Assembly
in an arbitrary exercise of power to ensure a Republican supermajority
for the next decade and dilute the votes of Democratic
electors.</p></li>

<li id="fn1"><p>Information regarding Judge Wingate’s political
affiliation was not available via a desktop search. Wingate was
reelected without opposition in 2014 in a nonpartisan election, winning
an eight-year term which expires on 1/1/2023. <em>See Thomas D.
Wingate</em>, <span class="smallcaps">Ballotpedia</span>, <a

<li id="fn2"><p>Dr. Imai used Monte Carlo simulation algorithms to
generate a representative set of possible redistricting maps under a
specified set of criteria. Dr. Imai testified that his analysis shows
that HB 2 makes Democratic leaning districts more competitive while
Republican leaning districts become safer; he testified that this
clearly demonstrates that HB 2 is a partisan gerrymander. He also opined
that SB 3’s First District was less compact than 99% of the simulated
plans. <em>Id.</em> at 5–10.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Dr. Caughey conducted his analysis in part using a
publicly available website, PlanScore (which calculates efficiency gap,
declination, and other metrics). He stated that HB 2 uses both packing
and cracking to maximize partisan gains statewide. Dr. Caughey concluded
that HB 2 is the most extreme advantage for a party in a legislative map
that he has ever seen. <em>Id.</em> at 10–13.<a href="#fnref3"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Mr. Trende testified that in evaluating HB 2, the
Efficiency Gap is unreliable in places like Kentucky because “in some
states, the political geography just naturally results in a circumstance
where it becomes hard to draw districts for one party or the other in
certain regions.” With respect to SB 3, Mr. Trende stated that Kentucky
Congressional Districts “have retained what we call district cores, the
same basic idea that corresponds to Kentucky’s political geographies
since the 90s.” <em>Id.</em> at 13–16.<a href="#fnref4"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Dr. Voss used Planscore to review and respond to Dr.
Caughey’s testimony. Dr. Voss stated that Kentucky naturally has a
higher Efficiency Gap based on its political geography, but did not find
any material inaccuracies in Dr. Caughey’s work; he testified that there
could have been fewer multi-split counties in HB 2 and if the law
requires HB 2 to multi-split counties the fewest number of times
possible, then HB 2 would violate this. As to SB3, Dr. Voss analyzed
some of Dr. Imai’s simulations and concluded that “the vast bulk of [Dr.
Imai’s] simulations are not more favorable to the Democrats than the
enacted plan.” <em>Id.</em> at 16–18.<a href="#fnref5"
