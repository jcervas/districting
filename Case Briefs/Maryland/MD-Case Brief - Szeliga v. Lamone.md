<li><p>On 12/21/2021, the 1773 Plaintiffs (Parrot et al.) (Republicans)
filed their Complaint for Declaratory and Other Relief Regarding the
Redistricting of Maryland's Congressional Districts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The 1773 Plaintiffs asked for a declaration that the 2021 Plan is
unlawful, as well as a permanent injunction against its use in
Congressional elections.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, the 1773 Plaintiffs asked the Court to order a new
map be prepared before the 2022 Congressional primaries or, in the
alternative, order that an alternative Congressional district map, which
was prepared by the Governor's Maryland Citizens Redistricting
Commission, be used for the 2022 Congressional elections.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 12/23/2021, the 1816 Plaintiffs (Szeliga et al.) filed their
Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The 1816 Plaintiffs asked for a declaration that the 2021 Plan is
unconstitutional under Articles 7, 24, and 40 of Maryland's Declaration
of Rights and Section 7 of Article I of the Maryland Constitution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Additionally, Plaintiffs sought to permanently enjoin the use of
the 2021 Plan and asked for an order to postpone the filing deadline for
candidates to declare their intention to compete in 2022 Congressional
primary elections until a new district map was prepared.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 2/16/2022, the Court heard argument and held the matter sub
curia; simultaneously, the Court issued its Memorandum Opinion and Order
denying the DCCC's Motion to Intervene.</p></li>
<li><p>On 2/22/2022, the Court consolidated the two cases.</p></li>
<li><p>The court heard expert testimony from Sean Trende, Dr. Thomas L.
Brunell, and John T. Willis, who claimed partisan gerrymandering, and
Dr. Allan J. Lichtman, who claimed no partisan gerrymandering.
<em>Id.</em> at 76–108.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The trial judge gave great weight to the testimony and evidence
presented and discussed by Sean Trende.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“His conclusions regarding extreme partisan gerrymandering in the
2021 Plan were undergirded with empirical data that could be reliably
tested and validly replicated.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Dr. Brunell's testimony was much less valuable and helpful to the
trial judge, because to evaluate compactness, the efficiency gap, as
presented, did not have the power that was portrayed in other
cases.</p></li>
<li><p>The opinion of Mr. Willis, while of interest to gain a
perspective as to what legislators considered in 2002, 2012, and
possibly in 2021, to draw the various Congressional boundaries, was not
helpful in the determination of whether "constitutional guideposts" have
been honored in the 2021 Plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Trial judge gave little weight to the testimony of Dr. Allan J.
Lichtman.</p></li>

<td><strong>Facts</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>On 8/6/2015, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan signed an executive
order which created the Maryland Redistricting Reform Commission.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>After several months of soliciting input from citizens and
legislators across the State, the Commission observed that Maryland's
constitution and laws offer no criteria or guidelines for congressional
redistricting, and that the Maryland Constitution is otherwise silent on
congressional districting.</p></li>
<li><p>The Commission recommended, among other things, that districting
criteria should include compactness, contiguity, congruence,
substantially equal population, and compliance with the Voting Rights
Act and other applicable federal laws.</p></li>
<li><p>The Commission also recommended the creation of an independent
redistricting body, whose members would be selected by a panel of
officials drawn from independent branches of government such as the
judiciary, charged with reapportioning the state's districts every ten
years after the decennial census.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>During each regular session of the General Assembly between 2016
and 2020, Governor Hogan caused one or more legislative bills to be
introduced that would have established a process by which State
legislative and congressional maps were created by an independent and
bipartisan commission, and ultimately by the Court of Appeals in the
event that the commission-proposed maps were not approved by the General
Assembly or were vetoed by the Governor.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>None of these bills was voted out of committee.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 1/12/2021, Governor Hogan issued an executive order
establishing the Maryland Citizens Redistricting Commission (MCRC) for
the purposes of redrawing the state's congressional and legislative
districting maps based on newly released census data.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The MCRC was comprised of nine Maryland registered voter
citizens, three Republicans, three Democrats, and three registered with
neither party.</p></li>
<li><p>After receiving public input and deliberating, on 11/5/2021, the
MCRC recommended a congressional redistricting map to Governor Hogan,
who accepted the MCRC's proposed final map and issued an order
transmitting the maps to the Maryland General Assembly for adoption at a
special session on 12/6/2021.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In 7/2021, following the 2020 decennial census, the General
Assembly's Legislative Redistricting Advisory Commission (the "LRAC")
was formed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The LRAC was charged with redrawing Maryland's congressional and
state legislative maps.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>At the conclusion of public hearings, the Department of
Legislative Services ("DLS") was directed to produce maps for the LRAC's
consideration; on 11/9/2021, the LRAC issued four maps for public review
and comment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On 11/23/2021, the LRAC chose a final map to submit to the
General Assembly for approval (the "2021 Plan").</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Neither Republican member of the LRAC supported the 2021
Plan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 12/7/2021, the Maryland House of Delegates voted to reject an
amendment that would have substituted the MCRC's map for the 2021
Plan.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Two Democrats joined all of the Republicans in voting to
substitute the MCRC's map for the Plan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 12/8/2021, the General Assembly enacted the 2021 Plan on a
strict party-line vote, which Governor Hogan vetoed on
12/9/2021.</p></li>
<li><p>On 12/9/2021, the General Assembly overrode Governor Hogan's
veto, thus adopting the 2021 Plan into law.</p></li>

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Rationale</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>While there are no provisions in the Maryland Constitution
explicitly addressing Congressional districting,<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
Article III, Section 4, of the Maryland Constitution does embody
standards by which the 2021 Congressional Plan can be evaluated to
determine whether unlawful partisan gerrymandering has occurred.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Alternatively, the strictures of Article III, Section 4 are . . .
applicable to the 2021 Plan because of the free elections clause as well
as the equal protection clause, which each, individually, provide a
nexus to Article III, Section 4 to determine the lawfulness of the 2021
Plan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Court rejected Defendants’ claim and ruled that the term
“legislative districts” includes Congressional districts, noting that
the Legislature was “keenly aware of its ability to restrict or expand
the application of Article III, Section 4, chose not to explicitly
exclude Congressional districts from the purview of Article III, Section
4, nor just reference State legislative districts” during the 1969 and
1972 amendments to art. III § 4. [<em>See</em> Arguments of Parties,
Defendants section <em>infra</em>.]</p></li>
<li><p>With respect to the use of a capital "L" in "Legislature," in the
Free Elections Clause, as reflecting only a reference to the state
legislature, the State's contention is belied by its own language.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Article 7, as it was originally adopted in 1776, was meant to
secure a right of participation; the language of Article 7 enunciated a
foundational right to vote for the only entity for which the citizens of
Maryland in 1776 had a participatory ability to elect through voting,
the Legislature.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“Our jurisprudence in Maryland indicates that the Free Elections
Clause has been broadly interpreted to apply to legislation that
infringes upon the right of political participation by citizens of the
State.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The pivotal goal of the Free Elections Clause, to protect the
right of political participation in Congressional elections, was
emphasized in <em>Green Party</em>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Plaintiffs have clearly stated a cause of action under the Free
Elections Clause and survive the Motion to Dismiss.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The treatment of similarly situated people under the law,
clearly, cannot be denied in Maryland, in derogation of the Fourteenth
Amendment; it also is clear that Maryland can afford greater protection
to its citizens under Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In <em>Green Party</em>, a nexus between the Equal Protection
Clause and a voting standards clause was established.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Court rejected the Defendants’ claims that the rights provided by
the Maryland Constitution were “coextensive” with rights provided in the
Fourteenth Amendment, because Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of
Rights adopted in 1776, preceded its federal counterpart, adopted in
1788, thereby contributing to the foundations of the latter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While Article 40 of Maryland's Declaration of Rights has been
generally regarded as coextensive with the First Amendment, the Court of
Appeals has recognized that Article 40 can have independent and
divergent application and interpretation.</p></li>
<li><p>The Court of Appeals has not shied away from "departing from the
United States Supreme Court's analysis of the parallel federal right"
when necessary "[to] ensure[] that the rights provided by Maryland law
are fully protected."</p></li>
<li><p>When a legislative act, such as the 2021 Plan, creates
Congressional districts that dilute the influence of certain voters
based upon their prior political expression—their partisan affiliation
and their voting history—it imposes a burden on a right or benefit, here
a fundamental right.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As a result, this Court, under Article 40, will apply strict
scrutiny to the 2021 Plan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Popular sovereignty dictates that the "Government" of the people
which "derives from them," is properly channeled when our democratic
process functions to reflect the will of the people.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Although the Maryland Declaration of Rights, like the
Constitution, is silent with respect to the right of its citizens to
challenge the primacy of political considerations in drawing legislative
districts, the Declaration of Rights does memorialize that the people
are guaranteed the right to wield their power through the elective
franchise, thereby safeguarding the sacred principle that the government
is, at all times, for the people and by the people.</p></li>
<li><p>The Constitution and Declaration of Rights must be read together
to determine the organic law of Maryland.</p></li>
<li><p>The judicial branch of government has a responsibility to limit
the Legislature from exerting extravagant or undue extension of power by
enforcing the standards of legislative districting outlined in Article
III, Section 4 of the Maryland Constitution and by the avoidance of
extreme partisan gerrymandering.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>After consideration of the evidence and testimony, the trial
judge agreed that there was a substantial deviation from "compactness"
as well as a failure to give "due regard" to "the boundaries of
political subdivisions" as required by Article III, Section 4.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>With regard to the violations of the of the Articles of the
Maryland Declaration of Rights, the 2021 Plan fails constitutional
muster under each Article.</p></li>
<li><p>With regard to Article 7 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,
the 2021 Congressional Plan, the Plaintiffs, based upon the evidence
adduced at trial, proved that the 2021 Plan was drawn with "partisanship
as a predominant intent, to the exclusion of traditional redistricting
criteria," accomplished by the party in power, to suppress the voice of
Republican voters.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, Article 24, the Maryland Equal Protection Clause,
applicable in redistricting cases, was violated under the 2021 Plan, and
the State has not provided a "compelling state interest" to rationalize
the adverse effect.</p></li>
<li><p>The same rationale holds true for the violation of Article 40 of
the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the Free Speech Article, which
requires a "strict scrutiny" analysis because a fundamental right is
implicated, a citizen's right to vote.</p></li>
<li><p>The 2021 Congressional Plan is unconstitutional, and subverts
that will of those governed.</p></li>

<td><strong>Arguments of Parties</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Plaintiffs</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assert a direct claim under Article III, Section 4, of the
Maryland Constitution and urge that the plain meaning of the term
"legislative district" corresponds to any legislative district in the
State, which must be subject to the standards of adjoining territory,
compactness, and equal population with due regard given to natural
boundaries of political subdivisions.</p></li>
<li><p>Assert that the 2021 Plan violates the Free Elections Clause in
several ways, including that the 2021 Plan "unlawfully seeks to
predetermine outcomes in Maryland's congressional districts."</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They also allege that the 2021 Plan violates Article 7, because
it is not based upon "well-established traditions in Maryland for
forming congressional districts[,]" including compactness, adjoining
territory, and respect for natural and political boundaries.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Assert that the 2021 Plan violates Article 24 by
unconstitutionally discriminating against Republican voters, including
Plaintiffs, and infringing on their fundamental right to vote.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Specifically, these Plaintiffs assert that the 2021 Plan
intentionally discriminates against Plaintiffs by diluting the weight of
their votes based on party affiliation and depriving them of the
opportunity for full and effective participation in the election of
their Congressional representatives.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Allege that the 2021 Plan violates Article 40 by "burdening
protected speech based on political viewpoint."</p></li>
<li><p>Plaintiffs argue that partisan gerrymandering is inconsistent
with the principles embodied by the Free Elections Clause, the Equal
Protection Clause, and the Free Speech Clause of the Declaration of
Rights, because it usurps the power of the people to choose those who
represent them in government and puts that power solely within the
purview of the Legislature.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They posit that usurping the power of voters to elect members of
Congress violates the general principles upon which the structure of
Maryland's Government and its Constitution were founded.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Defendants</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Claim that the text of Article III, Section 4, is limited to
State legislative districting because the term "legislative districts"
refers "unambiguously to State legislative districts" whenever it
appears in other provisions of the Constitution, and that when Congress
is referred to the "c" is capitalized.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Argue that although a 1967 constitutional convention proposed a
draft that included Constitutional standards for both state districts
and Congressional districting, the voters rejected the draft and that
the General Assembly drew the current Article III, Section 4 without
reference to Congressional redistricting to enable the 1969 amendments
to the Constitution to be adopted.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Argue that the 2021 Congressional Plan does not violate the Free
Elections Clause of Article 7, because that Section applies only to
state elections.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The State observes that the capitalization of "L" in
"Legislature," is a direct reference to the General Assembly.</p></li>
<li><p>Assert that the legislative history of Article 7, particularly
surrounding debates regarding the frequency of elections, indicates that
the Free Elections Clause could not apply to federal elections, "for
which the State is powerless to control the frequency."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Assert that the Plaintiffs have offered no basis for an
interpretation broader than that by the Supreme Court of the Fourteenth
Amendment in <em>Rucho</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The State posits that the scope of equal protection in Maryland
is the same as, that which is embodied in the federal constitution in
the Fourteenth Amendment.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Argue in their Motion to Dismiss that the Plaintiffs' claims
under Article 40 purport to "parrot" free speech claims that are the
same as those offered under the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution, which the Supreme Court has rejected in the redistricting
context. <em>Rucho</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assert that the because the Maryland Court of Appeals has
generally treated the rights enshrined under Articles 40 as
"coextensive" with its federal counterpart and has specifically adhered
to Supreme Court guidance regarding partisan gerrymandering claims, the
free speech cause of action should have been dismissed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Posit that judicially manageable standards do not exist under the
Maryland Constitution, and further, applicable statutes adjudicating
claims regarding Congressional districts do not exist in Maryland.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Argues, either Congress or the General Assembly must decide to
impose statutory restrictions or adopt constitutional amendments to
regulate Congressional districting.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Until congressional or state action is taken, Defendants aver
that Plaintiffs will continue to lack a remedy under the Maryland
Constitution or Declaration of Rights.</p></li>
