<td><strong>Procedural History</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>On 11/16/2021, the plaintiffs, North Carolina League of
Conservation Voters, Inc. et al. (NCLCV), filed a motion for preliminary
injunction, alleging that the 2021 districting plans violated the North
Carolina Constitution by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establishing severe partisan gerrymanders in violation of the
Free Elections Clause, art. I, § 10, the Equal Protection Clause, art.
I, § 19, and the Freedom of Speech and Assembly Clauses, art. I, §§ 12
and 14; and</p></li>
<li><p>By engaging in racial vote dilution in violation of the Free
Elections Clause, Art. I, § 10, and the Equal Protection Clause, art. I,
§ 19; and by violating the Whole County Provisions, art. II, §§ 3(3) and
5(3).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 11/18/2021, separate plaintiffs, Harper et al., filed a
similar motion alleging that the maps violated the <span
class="smallcaps">N.C. Const.</span> art. I, §§ 10, 12, 14, and
19.</p></li>
<li><p>On 11/19 and 11/22/2021, respectively, the two actions were
assigned to a three-judge panel, and, on 12/3/2021, the Superior Court,
Wake County, denied the two motions for preliminary injunction.</p></li>
<li><p>The plaintiffs filed an appeal with the N.C. Court of Appeals,
which denied their request for a temporary stay.</p></li>
<li><p>Plaintiffs subsequently filed several petitions with the N.C.
Supreme Court, which, on 12/8/2021, granted the preliminary injunction
and temporary stayed the candidate filing period until a judgment on the
merits was reached—a ruling was ordered to be issued by 1/11/2022.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(On 12/13/2021, the Common Cause plaintiffs moved to intervene,
were granted their motion on 12/16, and filed their complaint on 12/16,
alleging similar claims as the NCLCV and Harper plaintiffs.)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 12/17/2021, the Legislative Defendants—along with the
remaining defendants—filed their answer, asserting numerous defenses.<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>The trial court made extensive factual findings based on the
evidence presented at trial; the factual findings confirmed plaintiffs'
assertions that each of the three enacted maps were "extreme partisan
outliers" and the product of "intentional, pro-Republican partisan
redistricting."</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The extensive factual findings of the expert testimonies are
detailed at <em>Harper</em>, 868, S.E.2d at 518–23.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Notwithstanding, despite the trial court’s findings of partisan
gerrymandering, the trial court concluded, as a matter of law, that
“claims of extreme partisan gerrymandering present purely political
questions that are nonjusticiable under the North Carolina Constitution”
and “that the enacted maps are not unconstitutional as a result of
partisan gerrymandering.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thus, the trial court denied the plaintiffs’ motions.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 1/11 and 1/12/2022, all plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to
the N.C. Supreme Court from the trial court’s final judgment.</p></li>

<li><p>On 2/24/2021, N.C. State Board of Elections Executive Director
Karen Brinson Bell recommended to the House Elections Law and Campaign
Finance Reform Committee that the 2022 primary elections be delayed to
provide more time for redistricting, due to the announced delay in the
release of full census data by the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Committee, however, rejected the recommendation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 8/5/2021, the General Assembly's Senate Committee on
Redistricting and Elections and House Redistricting Committee met to
begin discussing the redistricting process.</p></li>
<li><p>On 8/9/2021, the chairs of the Joint Redistricting Committee
(JRC) released its proposed criteria by which to redistrict.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The JRC rejected public comment from citizens and legislators to
“change the criteria, which mandated a ‘race-blind’ approach, to allow
for the consideration of racial data in order to ensure compliance with
the Voting Rights Act (VRA).”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>The JRC adopted its final criteria on 8/12/2021.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 10/5/2021, after 13 public hearings across the state, the
House and Senate Redistricting Committees began the redistricting
process.</p></li>
<li><p>On 10/6/2021, computer stations were set up for legislators to
draw their maps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The stations would be open during business hours, and both the
rooms and the screens of the station computers would be live-streamed
and available for public viewing while the stations were open.</p></li>
<li><p>In an effort to show transparency, Legislative Defendants
"requir[ed] legislators to draw and submit maps using software on
computer terminals in the redistricting committee hearing rooms” and
Senate Committees would only consider maps drawn and submitted on the
software."</p>
<ul>
<li><p>However, the House and Senate Committees did not actively prevent
legislators and their staff from relying on pre-drawn maps created using
political data, or even direct consultation of political data."</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Proposed versions of the maps were filed on 10/28 and 10/29/2021,
and final maps were adopted on 11/3 and 11/4/2021; on 11/4/2021, the
maps were ratified into law, passed along strict party-line votes in
each chamber.</p></li>

<td><strong>Rationale</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p><strong>STANDING</strong> - Court rejected the trial court’s
ruling that there was no “deprivation of a constitutionally guaranteed
personal right”—and thus no standing—because "the federal injury-in-fact
requirement has no place in the text or history of [the N.C.]
Constitution." <em>Committee to Elect Dan Forest v. Employees Political
Action Committee</em>, 853 S.E.2d 698 (N.C. 2021).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the case of direct constitutional challenges to statutes or
other acts of government, the court requires only the requisite
"concrete adverseness.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Alleging a violation of a legal right which belongs to a person,
even if widely shared with others and even if they are not entitled to
relief under their theory of the legal right, is sufficient to show the
requisite "concrete adverseness" in N.C. courts which the court, for
purely pragmatic reasons (i.e., <u>not a limitation on judicial
power</u>), requires in the resolution of constitutional
questions.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Therefore, the trial court contravened the concrete adverseness
rationale for the direct injury requirement by concluding that
plaintiffs lacked standing because their partisan gerrymandering claims
were not cognizable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>POLITICAL QUESTION JUSTICIABILITY</strong><a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> –
In a case of first impression, the court rejected Legislative
Defendants’ claim that partisan gerrymandering claims present a
nonjusticiable "purely political question,” because while the Supreme
Court has concluded that partisan gerrymandering claims are
nonjusticiable in federal courts, “it does not follow that they are
nonjusticiable in North Carolina courts.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The trial court and Legislative Defendants rely in part on
<em>Rucho</em> and other federal cases—which may be instructive, but
they are certainly not controlling.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"While federal standing doctrine can be instructive as to general
principles . . . and for comparative analysis, the nuts and bolts of
North Carolina standing doctrine are not coincident with federal
standing doctrine."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In contrast to the three considerations used in <em>Rucho</em> to
find nonjusticiability (lack of a “judicially determinable” standard;
absence of a standard that was “clear, manageable[,] and politically
neutral”; and the role of federal courts in the constitutional system),
here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) the N.C. Constitution is "is more detailed and specific than
the federal Constitution in the protection of the rights of its
citizens."</p></li>
<li><p>(2) N.C. state law provides more specific neutral criteria
against which to evaluate alleged partisan gerrymanders, and those
criteria would not require the court system to consider 50 separate sets
of criteria, as would federal court involvement.</p></li>
<li><p>(3) <em>Rucho</em> was substantially concerned with the role of
federal courts in policing partisan gerrymandering, while recognizing
the independent capacity of state courts to review such claims under
state constitutions as a justification for judicial abnegation at the
federal level.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Gerrymandering claims are justiciable because reapportionment is
<em>not</em> committed to the sole discretion of the General Assembly—to
find otherwise would be “flatly inconsistent with [the court’s]
precedent interpreting and applying constitutional limitations on the
General Assembly's redistricting authority.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The mere fact that responsibility for reapportionment is
committed to the General Assembly does not mean that the General
Assembly's decisions in carrying out its responsibility are fully
immunized from any judicial review.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If "members of the General Assembly" could violate some
constitutional rights, "they might with equal authority, not only render
themselves the Legislators of the State for life, without any further
election of the people, [but] from thence transmit the dignity and
authority of legislation down to their heirs male forever."</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><u>Partisan Gerrymandering claims are justiciable because
partisan gerrymandering violates the Declaration of Rights in the N.C.
Constitution.</u></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>principle of equality</strong> ("all persons are
created equal") and the <strong>principle of popular
sovereignty</strong> ("political power" of the people is channeled
through the proper functioning of the democratic processes of the
constitutional system to the people's representatives in government) are
the two most fundamental principles of the Declaration of Rights.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While these are two separate fundamental principles under the
present constitutional system, one cannot exist without the
other.</p></li>
<li><p>If through state action the ruling party chokes off the channels
of political change on an unequal basis, then government ceases to
"derive[ ]" its power from the people or to be "founded upon their will
only," and the principle of political equality that is fundamental to
the Declaration of Rights and the democratic constitutional system is
violated.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(1) The free elections clause reflects the principle of the
Glorious Revolution that those in power shall not attain "electoral
advantage" through the dilution of votes and that representative bodies
. . . must be "free and lawful."</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Historical sources indicate that the founders did not hold the
limited view that the only requirement for an election to be a "free"
election was that those qualified had access to the ballot box . . .
rather, they adhered to the broad principles of the Glorious
Revolution—that all attempts to manipulate the electoral process,
especially through vote dilution on a partisan basis, as in the "rotten
boroughs" of England, would be prohibited.</p></li>
<li><p>When the legislature denies to certain voters this substantially
equal voting power, including when the denial is on the basis of voters'
partisan affiliation, elections are not free and do not serve to
effectively ascertain the will of the people.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(2) Partisan gerrymandering claims are cognizable under the equal
protection clause of the Declaration of Rights because "the fundamental
right to vote on equal terms” includes the right to "substantially equal
voting power and substantially equal legislative representation."</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When on the basis of partisanship the General Assembly enacts a
districting plan that diminishes or dilutes a voter's opportunity to
aggregate with likeminded voters to elect a governing majority—that is,
when a districting plan systematically makes it harder for one group of
voters to elect a governing majority than another group of voters of
equal size—the General Assembly unconstitutionally infringes upon that
voter's fundamental rights to vote on equal terms and to substantially
equal voting power.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(3) Partisan gerrymandering violates the freedoms of speech and
association and undermines their role in our democratic system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When legislators apportion district lines in a way that dilutes
the influence of certain voters based on their prior political
expression—their partisan affiliation and their voting history—it
imposes a burden on a right or benefit, here the fundamental right to
equal voting power on the basis of their views.</p></li>
<li><p>When the General Assembly systematically diminishes or dilutes
the power of votes on the basis of party affiliation, it intentionally
engages in a form of viewpoint discrimination and retaliation that
triggers strict scrutiny.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Lastly, Partisan gerrymandering claims do not require the making
of "policy choices and value determinations."</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Such claims are discernable under the N.C. Constitution and
precedent and there are several manageable standards for evaluating the
extent to which districting plans dilute votes on the basis of partisan
affiliation (e.g., mean-median, efficiency gap, close-votes/close-seats,
and partisan symmetry analyses, etc.).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>ELECTIONS CLAUSE ARGUMENT (i.e., Independent State
Legislature Theory)</strong><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> – Court rejected the
Legislative Defendants’ argument, which was not presented at trial, as
“inconsistent with nearly a century of precedent of the Supreme Court of
the United States affirmed as recently as 2015” and “repugnant to the
sovereignty of states, the authority of state constitutions, and the
independence of state courts,” nothing that it “would produce absurd and
dangerous consequences.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This theory contradicts the holding of <em>Rucho</em>, where the
U.S. Supreme Court said that "[p]rovisions in . . . state constitutions
can provide standards and guidance for state courts to apply" in a case
addressing the justiciability of partisan gerrymandering claims in
congressional plans.</p></li>
<li><p>A long line of decisions by the Supreme Court of the United
States confirm the view that state courts may review state laws
governing federal elections to determine whether they comply with the
state constitution.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING</strong> – Court held that each
of the 2021 plans violated the Declaration of Rights as partisan
gerrymanders.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) Congressional Map</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Based on Dr. Mattingly's ensemble analysis, the trial court found
"that the Congressional Map is the product of intentional,
pro-Republican partisan redistricting.”</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, the court considered various "mean-median
difference,” "efficiency gap,” "the lopsided margins test,” and
"partisan symmetry" analyses provided, and found "that the 2021
Congressional Plan is a partisan outlier intentionally and carefully
designed to maximize Republican advantage in North Carolina's
Congressional delegation."</p></li>
<li><p>Defendants also had not shown that the 2021 congressional map was
narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest, and therefore
the map failed strict scrutiny; partisan advantage is neither a
compelling nor a legitimate governmental interest.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Court made similar determinations for both the State House Map
and the State Senate Map, <em>see</em> <em>Harper</em>, 868 S.E.2d at
555–58.</p></li>

<td><ul>
<li><p>“With this decision, unguided by the constitutional text, four
members of this Court become policymakers. They wade into the political
waters by mandating their approach to redistricting.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“They lament that the people have not placed a provision in our
constitution for a ‘citizen referendum’ and use the absence of such a
provision to justify their judicial activism to amend our
constitution.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Because the General Assembly serves as "the agent of the people
for enacting laws," the General Assembly has plenary power, and a
restriction on the General Assembly is in fact a restriction on the
people themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Court presumes that legislation is constitutional, and a
constitutional limitation upon the General Assembly must be (1)
<u>express</u> and (2) proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>When this Court looks for constitutional limitations on the
General Assembly's authority, it looks to the <u>plain text</u> of the
constitution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Like the Federal Constitution, there is no provision in the N.C.
state constitution remotely comparable to the express provision in the
Florida Constitution (i.e., an explicit prohibition against partisan
gerrymandering).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Instead, the majority “inexplicably” takes the Supreme Court's
statement in <em>Rucho</em> that the "[p]rovisions in state statutes and
state constitutions can provide standards and guidance for state courts
to apply," as an unrestricted license to judicially amend the
constitution.</p></li>
<li><p>The N.C. Constitution could have a provision like the Florida
Constitution—but, to do so properly requires the amendment process
authorized in the constitution itself, allowing the people to determine
the wisdom of this new policy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The majority fails to recognize that its political science-based
approach (requiring proportionality and the use of various political
science tests) necessarily involves policy decisions and that these are
the same policy determinations about which the Supreme Court warned in
<em>Rucho</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The majority inserts a requirement of "partisan fairness" into
the constitution; under the majority's newly created policy, any
redistricting that diminishes or dilutes an individual's vote on the
basis of partisanship is unconstitutional.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This vague notion of fairness does not answer how to measure
whether groups of voters are of equal size or how to predict the results
an election would produce.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The majority also bases its reasoning on several false
assumptions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) plaintiffs' experts and now the majority appear to assume
that voters will vote along party lines in future elections.</p></li>
<li><p>(2) in equating partisan affiliation to an immutable
characteristic and then elevating its protection to strict scrutiny, the
majority also fails to consider that party affiliation can change at any
point or be absent altogether.</p></li>
<li><p>(3) the majority's policy decision erroneously assumes that a
voter's interests can never be adequately represented by someone from a
different party.</p></li>
<li><p>In sum, there is no judicially discernible manageable standard.
As thoroughly discussed in <em>Rucho</em>, the majority's approach is
replete with policy determinations . . . [and] [t]hus, the case is
nonjusticiable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The issue is also textually committed to the General Assembly,
and is therefore nonjusticiable.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Both the Federal Constitution and the N.C. Constitution textually
assign redistricting authority to the legislature.</p></li>
<li><p>The role of the judiciary through judicial review is [solely] to
decide challenges regarding whether a redistricting plan violates the
objective limitations in art. II, §§ 3 and 5 of the constitution or a
provision of federal law.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>As to the <em>Stephenson</em> requirements, “the Court in
<em>Stephenson</em> was not forcing the legislative defendants to
conduct a VRA analysis. Rather, the Court was merely stating that if
Section 2 requires VRA districts, those districts must be drawn first so
that the remaining non-VRA districts can be drawn in compliance with the
Whole County Provisions.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Here, the trial court found that there was no showing that race
was the predominant factor in drawing the districts, and thus a VRA
analysis was not required.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>None of the clauses in the Declaration of Rights have been
interpreted as a restriction on partisan considerations in
redistricting—even after hundreds of years of apportionments and decades
of redistricting litigation—until today.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finding no explicit constitutional provision prohibiting partisan
gerrymandering, the majority creatively attempts to mine the Declaration
of Rights to find or create some protection for a political group's
right to their preferred form of representation and a "fair" share of
the "voting power."</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Moreover, the Declaration of Rights protects the individual's
rights, not a political group's rights.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The individual right to participate in a "free election" does not
include the right to have one's preferred candidate elected or a
political group's right to proportional representation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Giving the provision its plain meaning, "free" means "free from
interference or intimidation."</p></li>
<li><p>The free elections clause was not meant to restrict the General
Assembly's presumptively constitutional ability to engage in partisan
gerrymandering.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>As to the right to vote on equal terms, an effort to gerrymander
districts to favor a political party does not alter voting power so long
as voters are permitted to (1) vote for the same number of
representatives as voters in other districts and (2) vote as part of a
constituency that is similar in size to that of the other districts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Therefore, because partisan gerrymandering does not infringe upon
a fundamental right, rational basis review applies (instead of strict
scrutiny).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Partisan gerrymandering plainly does not place any restriction
upon the espousal of a particular viewpoint.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Opponents of a redistricting plan are free to voice their
opposition.</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, partisan gerrymandering—and public disdain for the
practice—has been ubiquitous throughout the state's history.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The people expressed their will in the 2020 election, which
utilized constitutionally compliant maps. Knowing that the 2021 General
Assembly would be tasked with redistricting, the people elected
them.</p></li>

<li id="fn2"><p>Argued that: (1) granting the requested relief will
violate the VRA and the U.S. Constitution; (2) granting the requested
relief will violate the rights of Legislative Defendants, Republican
voters, and Republican candidates under the U.S. and N.C. Constitutions;
(3) the court cannot lawfully prevent the General Assembly from
considering partisan advantage and incumbency protection; (4) plaintiffs
seek to require districts where Democratic candidates are elected where
such candidates are not currently elected; (5) plaintiffs' claims are
barred by the doctrine of laches; (6) plaintiffs have failed to state
claims upon which relief can be granted; (7) plaintiffs seek a theory of
liability that will act to impose a judicial amendment to the N.C.
Constitution; (8) the only limitations on redistricting legislation are
found in art. II, §§ 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the N.C. Constitution; (9)
plaintiffs' request for a court-designed redistricting plan violates the
separation of powers doctrine; (10) plaintiffs' claims are
nonjusticiable and fail to provide judicially manageable standards; (11)
plaintiffs lack standing; and (12) plaintiffs have unclean hands and
therefore are not entitled to equitable relief.<a href="#fnref2"

have been wholly committed to the "sole discretion" of a coordinate
branch of government, and those questions which can be resolved only by
making "policy choices and value determinations." <em>Bacon v. Lee</em>,
549 S.E.2d 840 (N.C. 2001). When presented with a purely political
question, the judiciary is neither constitutionally empowered nor

Notably, the Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether the North
Carolina Supreme Court has the power to strike down the legislature’s
illegally gerrymandered congressional map for violating the North
Carolina Constitution under this theory in <em>Moore v. Harper</em>.
Oral argument will be heard sometime during the October 2022–23 term.
