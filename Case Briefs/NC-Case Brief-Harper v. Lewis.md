<li><p>On 9/27/2019, Plaintiffs filed a verified complaint in Superior
Court, Wake County, seeking a declaration that the 2016 congressional
districts violate the rights of Plaintiffs and all Democratic voters in
North Carolina under the North Carolina Constitution's Free Elections
Clause, Art. I, § 10; Equal Protection Clause, Art. I, § 19; and Freedom
of Speech and Freedom of Assembly Clauses, Art. I, §§ 12 &amp; 14.</p>

congressional districts.</p></li>

<li><p>On 9/30/2019, this action was assigned to the panel by the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina.</p></li>
<li><p>On 9/30/2019, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary
injunction.</p></li>
<li><p>On 10/14/2019, the Legislative Defendants attempted to remove
this case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of North Carolina, and on 10/22/2019, the federal court remanded the

<td><strong>Facts</strong></td>

<li><p>On 2/19/2016, the current North Carolina congressional districts
(hereinafter "2016 congressional districts") were established by an act
of the General Assembly, S.L. 2016-1, as a result of litigation in
federal court over the congressional districts originally drawn in
2011.</p></li>

<td><strong>The Rule(s)</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Declaration of Rights, <span class="smallcaps">N.C. Const.</span>
art. I, § 10 (Free Elections Clause).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Declares that "[a]ll elections shall be free."</p></li>
<li><p>The meaning of the Free Elections Clause is that elections must
be conducted freely and honestly to ascertain, fairly and truthfully,
the will of the people.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In contrast, extreme partisan gerrymandering—namely redistricting
plans that entrench politicians in power, that evince a fundamental
distrust of voters by serving the self-interest of political parties
over the public good, and that dilute and devalue votes of some citizens
compared to others—is contrary to the fundamental right of NC citizens
to have elections conducted freely and honestly to ascertain, fairly and
truthfully, the will of the people.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><span class="smallcaps">N.C. Const.</span> art. I, § 19 (Equal
Protection Clause).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Guarantees to all North Carolinians that "[n]o person shall be
denied the equal protection of the laws."</p></li>
<li><p>NC’s Equal Protection Clause protects "the fundamental right of
each North Carolinian to substantially equal voting power."
<em>Stephenson v. Bartlett</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the NC Constitution provides greater protection for
voting rights than the federal Equal Protection Clause, our courts use
the same test as federal courts in evaluating the constitutionality of
challenged classifications under an equal protection analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) the plaintiffs challenging a districting plan must prove that
state officials' "predominant purpose" in drawing district lines was to
"entrench [their party] in power" by diluting the votes of citizens
favoring their rival.</p></li>
<li><p>(2) the plaintiffs must establish that the lines drawn in fact
have the intended effect by "substantially" diluting their
votes.</p></li>
<li><p>(3) if the plaintiffs make those showings, the State must provide
a legitimate, non-partisan justification (i.e., that the impermissible
intent did not cause the effect) to preserve its map.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Partisan gerrymandering runs afoul of the State's obligation to
provide all persons with equal protection of law because, by seeking to
diminish the electoral power of supporters of a disfavored party, a
partisan gerrymander treats individuals who support candidates of one
political party less favorably than individuals who support candidates
of another party.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><span class="smallcaps">N.C. Const.</span> art. I, § 12 (Freedom
of Assembly Clause).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provides, in relevant part, that "[t]he people have a right to
assemble together to consult for their common good, to instruct their
representatives, and to apply to the General Assembly for redress of
grievances."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><span class="smallcaps">N.C. Const.</span> art. I, § 14 (Freedom
of Speech Clause).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provides that "[f]reedom of speech and of the press are two of
the great bulwarks of liberty and therefore shall never be
restrained."</p></li>
<li><p>When a legislature engages in extreme partisan gerrymandering, it
identifies certain preferred speakers (e.g., Republican voters) while
targeting certain disfavored speakers (e.g., Democratic voters) because
of disagreement with the views they express when they vote.</p></li>
<li><p>A legislature that engages in extreme partisan gerrymandering
burdens the associational rights of disfavored voters to "instruct their
representatives, and to apply to the General Assembly for redress of
grievances."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Injunctive Relief Standard</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"The purpose of a preliminary injunction is ordinarily to
preserve the status quo pending trial on the merits.</p></li>
<li><p>A preliminary injunction is an "extraordinary remedy" and will
issue "only (1) if a plaintiff is able to show likelihood of success on
the merits of his case and (2) if a plaintiff is likely to sustain
irreparable loss unless the injunction is issued, or if, in the opinion
of the Court, issuance is necessary for the protection of a plaintiffs
rights during the course of litigation."</p></li>
<li><p>When assessing the preliminary injunction factors, the trial
judge "should engage in a balancing process, weighing potential harm to
the plaintiff if the injunction is not issued against the potential harm
to the defendant if injunctive relief is granted.</p></li>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Holding(s)</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Court held that the Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction
was warranted in regard to the 2016 congressional districts because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) Court agrees with Plaintiffs and finds there is a substantial
likelihood that Plaintiffs will prevail on the merits of this action by
showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the 2016 congressional districts
are extreme partisan gerrymanders in violation of the North Carolina
Constitution's Free Elections Clause, Art. I, § 10; Equal Protection
Clause, Art. I, § 19; and Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Assembly
Clauses, Art. I, §§ 12 &amp; 14.</p></li>
<li><p>(2) The loss to Plaintiffs' fundamental rights guaranteed by the
North Carolina Constitution will undoubtedly be irreparable if
congressional elections are allowed to proceed under the 2016
congressional districts.</p></li>
<li><p>(3) The risk that Plaintiffs' and all North Carolinians'
fundamental rights guaranteed by the North Carolina Constitution will be
irreparably lost outweighs the Legislative Defendants’ harm (i) that the
General Assembly will be prevented from effectuating an act of the
General Assembly, and (ii) the disruption, confusion, and uncertainty in
the electoral process for them, candidates, election officials, and the
voting public.</p></li>

<td><strong>Rationale</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p><strong>Political Question Doctrine</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Court rejected the Legislative Defendants’ claim that challenges
to the validity of an act of the General Assembly that apportions or
redistricts the congressional districts of this State present
non-justiciable political questions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Such claims are within the statutorily-provided jurisdiction of
this three-judge panel, N.C.G.S. § 1-267.1, and partisan gerrymandering
claims specifically present justiciable issues—they fall within the
broad, default category of constitutional cases our courts are empowered
and obliged to decide on the merits, and not within the narrow category
of exceptional cases covered by the political question
doctrine.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Standing of Plaintiffs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Court rejected the Legislative Defendants’ claim that plaintiffs
lacked standing because the NC Constitution provides: "All courts shall
be open; every person for an injury done him in his lands, goods,
person, or reputation shall have remedy by due course of law; and right
and justice shall be administered without favor, denial, or delay."
<span class="smallcaps">N.C. Const.</span> art. I, § 18.</p></li>
<li><p>"[B]ecause North Carolina courts are not constrained by the 'case
or controversy' requirement of Article III of the United States
Constitution, our State's standing jurisprudence is broader than federal
law."</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Although the NC Supreme Court "has declined to set out specific
criteria necessary to show standing in every case, [it] has emphasized
two factors in its cases examining standing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) the presence of a legally cognizable injury; and</p></li>
<li><p>(2) a means by which the courts can remedy that injury."</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Plaintiffs in this case have standing to challenge the
congressional districts at issue because Plaintiffs have shown a
likelihood of "a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy," and
a likelihood that the 2016 congressional districts cause them to "suffer
harm[.]"</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the
Merits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The 2016 congressional districts have already been the subject of
years-long litigation in federal court arising from challenges to the
districts on partisan gerrymandering grounds, and, as such, there is a
detailed record of both the partisan intent and the intended partisan
effects of the 2016 congressional districts drawn with the aid of Dr.
Thomas Hofeller and enacted by the General Assembly. <em>See
Rucho</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dr. Hofeller was directed by legislators "to use political data .
. . in drawing the remedial plan," and was further instructed to "use
that political data to draw a map that would maintain the existing
partisan makeup of the state's congressional delegation. . . .</p></li>
<li><p>The redistricting committee approved several criteria for the
map-drawing process, including the use of past election data (i.e.,
"Political Data") and another labeled "Partisan Advantage.”<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>When drawing the 2016 congressional districts, Dr. Hofeller used
"an aggregate variable he created to predict partisan performance" all
while "constantly aware of the partisan characteristics of each county,
precinct, and VTD."</p></li>
<li><p>The redistricting committee, and ultimately the General Assembly
as a whole, approved the 2016 congressional districts by party-line
vote.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Loss Unless the
Injunction is Issued</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because Plaintiffs' have shown a likelihood of succeeding on the
merits of their claims, Plaintiffs are likely to sustain irreparable
loss to their fundamental rights guaranteed by the NC Constitution
unless the injunction is issued, and likewise, issuance is necessary for
the continued protection of Plaintiffs' fundamental rights guaranteed by
during the course of the litigation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Balancing of Equities Weighs in Favor of
Plaintiffs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While State Defendants would prefer not to move elections or
otherwise change the current schedule for the 2020 congressional primary
election, they recognize that proceeding under the 2016 congressional
districts "would require the Board to administer an election that
violates the constitutional rights of North Carolina voters" and
acknowledge that the election schedule can be changed if
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>While the timing of Plaintiffs' action does weigh against
Plaintiffs (filing months after litigation concluded in the federal
court), the Court does not find that the timing of Plaintiffs' filing of
this action should bar them from seeking equitable relief.</p></li>
