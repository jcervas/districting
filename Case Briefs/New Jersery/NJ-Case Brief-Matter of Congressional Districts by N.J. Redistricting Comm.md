<td><strong>Procedural History</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Plaintiffs, the Republican delegation to the Commission, filed an
amended complaint on 1/5/2022 to challenge the map selected by the
independent Chair, and filed their complaint directly with the NJ
Supreme Court, pursuant to Article II, Section 2, Paragraph 7 of the NJ
Constitution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plaintiffs asked the Court to vacate the Commission's decision
and remand the matter to the Commission for further proceedings, with
the Chair recused.</p></li>
<li><p>Plaintiffs argued that the actions of the Chair were "arbitrary,
capricious, and unreasonable," violated "federal and state
constitutional equal protection and due process protections," and posed
a "common law conflict of interest."</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The complaint also asserted that there were "significant
differences between the [two] maps" and described ways in which the
Republican delegation's map better met the standards the Chair had
applied.</p></li>
<li><p>Plaintiffs did not, however, “assert that the map the Commission
adopted . . . was itself ‘unlawful.’”</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Defendants, the Democratic delegation to the Commission, filed a
motion to dismiss the amended complaint, asserting that the amended
complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be
granted.</p></li>
<li><p>On 2/2/2022, Plaintiffs submitted a second amended complaint, and
added the Princeton Gerrymandering Project (PGP) as a defendant, arguing
that “the group advised and provided independent analysis of the
parties' proposed redistricting maps to the Chair during the
redistricting process and breached an alleged promise of confidentiality
by providing valuable feedback to the Democratic delegation.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plaintiffs also alleged that PGP was supported by private donors
who have contributed to Democratic officials and causes.</p></li>

<td><strong>Facts</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Under the NJ Constitution, the Redistricting Commission is
initially comprised of six individuals affiliated with the Democratic
Party, and six who are affiliated with the Republican Party.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A thirteenth member is to be selected by the members, who will
then serve as Chair and tiebreaker.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Here, because the original twelve members were unable to agree on
a thirteenth member by a majority vote, each delegation submitted one
name to the Court.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>From those names, the Court had to select the thirteenth member,
in accordance with the Constitution; the Court chose the Hon. John E.
Wallace, Jr. (ret.), to serve as the independent member, and neither
party objected.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 12/22/2021, a majority of the Commission's members—including
the Chair—voted in favor of the map the Democratic delegation
presented.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In deciding between the two maps, the Chair concluded that both
maps were constitutional, and noted that “[t]he only area where one map
[the Democrat’s] pulled ahead of the other is in partisan fairness.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>However, the Chair did not rely on this factor in making his
determination.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Rather, the Chair stated that, “In the end, I decided to vote for
the Democratic map, simply because in the last redistricting map it was
drawn by the Republicans. Thus, I conclude that fairness dictates that
the Democrats have the opportunity to have their map used for this next
redistricting cycle.”</p></li>

<td><strong>The Rule(s)</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Justiciability of the NJ Supreme Court Over the Redistricting
Process</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Court has no role in the outcome of the redistricting process
unless the map is "unlawful." <span class="smallcaps">N.J. Const.</span>
art. II, § 2, ¶¶ 7, 9.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>So long as the final map is constitutional, the Court cannot
grant any relief.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If it is [unconstitutional], the Commission must reassemble and
adopt another redistricting plan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Standing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>NJ jurisprudence takes a more liberal approach to standing than
federal law; the State Constitution does not limit " judicial power to
actual cases and controversies."</p></li>
<li><p>To possess standing in state court, a party must have "a
sufficient stake in the outcome of the litigation" and "real
adverseness," and there must be "a substantial likelihood that the party
will suffer harm in the event of an unfavorable decision."</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Weight is also given to the public's interest in the resolution
of a matter and favor a just ruling on the merits over "procedural
frustrations."</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Requirements of a Constitutional NJ Redistricting Map</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"[C]ongressional districts . . . shall be geographically
contiguous" and account for each district's total population;</p></li>
<li><p>"Mapmakers shall comply with the Voting Rights Act" and other
relevant authority, and</p></li>
<li><p>"[S]hould include sufficient numbers of minority/majority
districts";</p></li>
<li><p>Maps "shall not split political subdivision boundaries and
communities of interest unless necessary" to comply with the above
standards;</p></li>
<li><p>"Competitive districts are favored";</p></li>
<li><p><u>“No district may be formed solely to favor or disfavor any
political party or the election of any person" (which the Chair
described as "partisan fairness");</u></p></li>
<li><p>"[D]istricts may include the cores of existing districts" "[to]
assist voters in assessing incumbents and minimizing voter confusion";
and</p></li>
<li><p>“All districts shall be as compact and regularly shaped as
possible unless deviation is required to comply with any of the above
standards."</p></li>

<td><strong>Holding(s)</strong></td>

<li><p>Court held that plaintiffs' allegations were insufficient to
support a claim upon which relief could be granted, because they did not
assert any constitutional violation.</p></li>
</ul></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Rationale</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>First, the Court rejected Defendants’ argument that plaintiffs
lacked standing, noting that they “have a strong stake in the outcome of
the redistricting process and are plainly adverse to the map
adopted.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Defendants’ assertion of personal harm as members of the
delegation is less strong, but the overriding public interest in this
case is compelling.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Resolving the map for congressional districts for the next
decade is of the utmost importance,” and “[d]oing so expeditiously, in
time for candidates and election officials to plan for the upcoming
primary and general elections, is also significant to the
public.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Court then determined that there was no justiciability,
because the maps were not unlawful.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Reasonable people may differ with a tiebreaker's evaluation of,
and support for, a particular plan, but that decision is not subject to
review by the Court unless the plan is unlawful or reflects invidious
discrimination.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“No count in the complaint . . . asserts that the final map
itself is unlawful or that it is the result of invidious
discrimination.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“Plaintiffs' argument focuses on the Chair's thought process but
does not allege how the map suffers from invidious discrimination or is
otherwise unlawful.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Court dismissed as moot the Plaintiffs’ arguments related to the
Chair’s amplified statement, because the Court did not rely on that
statement in consideration of this matter.</p></li>
<li><p>Court similarly dismissed the Plaintiffs’ arguments in their
second amended complaint as to PGP, because the “plaintiffs' additional
claim[s] do[] not assert that the redistricting plan is unlawful or is
the result of invidious discrimination,” and therefore falls outside the
Court's “limited scope of review in redistricting matters and therefore
cannot prevail.”</p></li>
<li><p>Court dismissed the common law conflict of interest claim.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Chair’s political contribution information was readily
available to the public and appears on the FEC’s public database of
contributions to candidates and committees in federal elections.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because plaintiffs either knew or reasonably should have known of
the contribution, they could have raised the argument earlier.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Instead, they did not object to the Chair's participation until
after he selected the other side's map.</p></li>
<li><p>On those facts, a strong argument can be made that plaintiffs
waived their conflict claim.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Also, “[b]ecause the Constitution specifies requirements for the
tiebreaker, we do not look to the common law, as plaintiffs request, to
insert additional qualifications.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Constitution does not bar the selection of a person who has
contributed to a political campaign or a partisan political group, or
whose spouse has done so, as the independent member, and therefore there
is no finding of disqualifying conduct.</p></li>

<td><strong>Arguments of Parties</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Plaintiffs</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Also raised a threshold argument contending that the Chair's
amplified statement of reasons cannot be considered because it violates
the State Constitution's public meeting requirement and analogous
principles in the Open Public Meetings Act (OPMA), N.J.S.A. 10:4-6 to
-21, failing to provide proper notice and due process.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Contended that the Chair had a conflict of interest under the
common law and should have recused himself because his wife made a
political contribution to a member of Congress from New Jersey in
2021.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Defendants</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contended that plaintiffs lack standing because they have no
"personal stake" and have not alleged a "personal injury."</p></li>
<li><p>Argued that the complaint must be dismissed because it presents a
nonjusticiable political question.</p></li>

<li id="fn2"><p>On 1/4/2022, the Court requested an amplified statement
of reasons to assist in its review of this matter. By analogy to Rule
2:5-1(b), which allows a trial judge or agency head to submit "an
amplification of a prior statement, opinion or memorandum" when an
appeal is taken, the Court asked the Chair to amplify the grounds for
his oral decision on 12/22/2021. The Chair presented a written statement
to the Court and the parties on 1/11/2022, and it was posted on the
Judiciary's website the same day.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
