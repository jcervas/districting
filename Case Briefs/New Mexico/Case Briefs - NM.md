<u>Case Briefing</u>

**NEW MEXICO**

-   *Republican Party of New Mexico* v. Oliver, No. D-506-CV-202200041
    (N.M. D. Ct. Jan. 21, 2022).

    -   Plaintiffs RPNM et al. filed a complaint alleging that “Senate
        Bill 1 . . . redraws New Mexico’s three congressional districts
        in contravention of traditional redistricting principles
        endorsed by the State Legislature and the New Mexico Supreme
        Court in order to accomplish a political gerrymander that
        unconstitutionally dilutes the votes of residents of
        southeastern New Mexico in order to achieve partisan advantage.”

    -   Plaintiffs requested, among other things, for final Judgment
        against Defendants, a declaration that Senate Bill 1 violates
        the New Mexico Constitution, and the adoption of a
        partisan-neutral congressional map consistent with Congressional
        Concept E (Justice Chávez’s map).

    -   Plaintiffs argued that SB1 is a political gerrymander in
        violation of Equal Protection, N.M. Const. art. II, § 18.
