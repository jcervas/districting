<td><strong>Procedural History</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>On 2/3/2022 (the same day that the Governor signed the
Legislature’s redistricting plan), petitioners—NY voters residing in
several different congressional districts—commenced this special
proceeding under Article III, § 5 of the State Constitution and
Unconsolidated Laws § 4221.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Petitioners alleged that the process was constitutionally
defective because the IRC failed to submit a second redistricting plan
as required under the 2014 constitutional amendments and, as such, the
legislature lacked authority to compose and enact its own plan.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Petitioners also asserted that the congressional map was
unconstitutionally gerrymandered in favor of the majority
party.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>State respondents answered that petitioners lacked standing to
challenge most of the districts they claimed were gerrymandered, that
the IRC’s failure to perform its duty did not strip the legislature of
its enduring authority to enact redistricting plans, and that
petitioners could not meet their burden of proving that the maps were
unconstitutionally partisan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>At trial, expert testimony was heard from both parties.</p></li>
<li><p>Subsequently, the State Supreme Court declared the congressional,
state senate, and state assembly maps “void,” reasoning that the
legislature’s enactment of maps absent submission of a second
redistricting plan by the IRC was unconstitutional and that the 2021
Legislation purporting to authorize the enactment was also
unconstitutional.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Further, crediting petitioner’s expert testimony, the State
Supreme Court found that petitioners had proven that the congressional
map violated the constitutional prohibition on partisan
gerrymandering.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>State respondents appealed, and, in a divided decision, the
Appellate Division modified the Supreme Court’s order by denying the
petition, in part, vacating the declaration that the senate and assembly
maps and the 2021 legislation were unconstitutional, but otherwise
affirmed and remitted.</p></li>
<li><p>Both parties cross-appealed the Appellate Division’s
order.</p></li>

<li><p>As modified, affirmed. The congressional and senate maps are
void.</p>

<td><strong>Facts</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>In 2014, the People of the State of New York voted to adopt
historic reforms to the redistricting process by establishing an
Independent Redistricting Commission (IRC), and by “declaring
unconstitutional certain undemocratic practices such as partisan and
racial gerrymandering.”</p></li>
<li><p>Following receipt of the results of the 2020 federal census, the
redistricting process began.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Due to shifts in NY’s population, the state lost 1 congressional
seat and other districts became malapportioned.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Throughout 2021, the IRC held public hearings, gathering input
from stakeholders and voters across the state.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In 12/2021 and 1/2022, negotiations between the IRC members
deteriorated and the IRC, split along party lines, was unable to agree
upon consensus maps.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>As a result of their disagreements, the IRC submitted, as a first
set of maps, two proposed redistricting plans to the legislature—maps
from each party delegation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The legislature voted on this first set of plans without
amendment as required by the Constitution and rejected both
plans.</p></li>
<li><p>The legislature notified the IRC of that rejection, triggering
the IRC’s obligation to compose within 15 days a second redistricting
plan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 1/24/2022—the day before the 15-day deadline but more than one
month before the 2/8/2022 deadline—the IRC announced that it was
deadlocked and would not present a second plan to the legislature.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Within a week, the Democrats in the legislature—in control of
both the senate and assembly—composed and enacted new congressional,
senate, and assembly redistricting maps without participation by the
minority Republican Party.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 2/3/2022, the Governor signed into law the new redistricting
legislation, which also “superseded” the 2% limitation imposed in 2012
on the legislature’s authority to amend IRC plans.</p></li>

<td><ul>
<li><p><span class="smallcaps">N.Y. Const</span>. art. III, § 4(b)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The IRC—a bipartisan commission working under a constitutionally
mandated timeline—is charged with the obligation of drawing a set of
redistricting maps that, with appropriate implementing legislation, must
be submitted to the legislature for a vote, without amendment.</p></li>
<li><p>If this first set of maps is rejected, the IRC is required to
prepare a second set that, again, would be subject to an up or down vote
by the legislature, without amendment.</p></li>
<li><p>Only upon rejection of a second set of IRC maps is the
legislature free to offer amendments to the maps created by the IRC,
and, even then, a statutory restriction enacted as a companion to the
constitutional reforms precluded legislative alterations that would
affect more than two percent of the population in any district.

</ul></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Rationale</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Petitioners have standing despite not residing in certain
challenged districts because standing is expressly conferred by
constitution and statute.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Article III, § 5 of the NY Constitution provides that “[a]n
apportionment by the legislature, or other body, shall be subject to
review by the supreme court, <em>at the suit of any citizen</em>, under
such reasonable regulations as the legislature may prescribe.”</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, Unconsolidated Laws § 4221 likewise authorizes “any
citizen” of the state to seek judicial review of a legislative act
establishing electoral districts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Upon careful review of the plain language of the Constitution and
the history pertaining to the adoption of the 2014 reforms, the
legislature and the IRC deviated from the constitutionally mandated
procedure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Article III, § 4 is permeated with language that, when given its
full effect, permits the legislature to undertake the drawing of
district lines only after two redistricting plans composed by the IRC
have been duly considered and rejected. Moreover, the text of section 4
contemplates that any redistricting act ultimately adopted must be
founded upon a plan submitted by the IRC. . . .” <em>Id.</em> at
*15.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It does not provide for the wholesale redrawing of new maps by
the Legislature.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“As reflected in the legislative record, the IRC’s fulfillment of
its constitutional obligations was unquestionably intended to operate as
a necessary precondition to, and limitation on, the legislature’s
exercise of its discretion in redistricting.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“Contrary to the State respondents’ contentions, the detailed
amendments leave no room for legislative discretion regarding the
particulars of implementation; this is not a scenario where the
Constitution fails to provide ‘specific guidance’ or is ‘silen[t] on the
issue[.]’”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The IRC-based process “<em>shall</em> govern redistricting in
this state <em>except</em> to the extent that a court is required to
order the adoption of, or changes to, a redistricting plan as a remedy
for a violation of law [emphasis added].” <span class="smallcaps">N.Y.
Const.</span> art. III, § 4(e).</p></li>
<li><p>The rigid framework serves to “incentiviz[e] the legislature to
encourage and support fair bipartisan participation and compromise
throughout the redistricting process.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Forecasting that the IRC would not comply with its constitutional
obligations, in the summer of 2021, the legislature attempted to amend
the constitution to add language authorizing it to introduce
redistricting legislation; after New York voters rejected this
constitutional amendment, the legislature attempted to fill a purported
“gap” in constitutional language by statutorily amending the IRC
procedure in the same manner.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>However, “the bipartisan process was placed in the State
Constitution specifically to insulate it from capricious legislative
action. . . .”</p></li>
<li><p>The 2021 legislation is therefore unconstitutional to the extent
that it permits the legislature to avoid a central requirement of the
reform amendments.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Court rejected the State respondents’ arguments that the evidence
was legally insufficient to establish an unconstitutional purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At the conclusion of the non-jury trial, the Supreme Court—based
on the partisan process, the map enacted by the legislature itself, and
the expert testimony proffered by petitioners—found by “clear evidence
and beyond a reasonable doubt that the congressional map was
unconstitutionally drawn with political bias” to “significantly
reduce[]” the number of competitive districts.</p></li>
<li><p>The Appellate Division affirmed, similarly drawing an inference
of invidious partisan purpose based on “evidence of the largely
one-party process used to enact the 2022 congressional map, a comparison
of the 2022 congressional map to the 2012 congressional map, and the
expert opinion and supporting analysis of Sean P. Trende,” finding that
“the 2022 congressional map was drawn to discourage competition and
favor democrats.”</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, there is record support in the undisputed facts and
evidence presented by petitioners for the affirmed finding that the 2022
congressional map was drawn to discourage competition.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Court rejected the State respondents’ <em>Purcell</em>
argument,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> refusing to “subject the People of
this state to an election conducted pursuant to an unconstitutional
reapportionment.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>With judicial supervision and the support of a neutral expert
designated as a special master, there is sufficient time for the
adoption of new district lines—although it will likely be necessary to
move the congressional and senate primary elections to August.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Court rejected the State respondents’ argument that the
Legislature be given a reasonable period to cure because the deadline
for the IRC to submit a second set of maps “ha[d] long since passed” and
was, at that time, incapable of cure.</p></li>

<li><p>Petitioners</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assert that, in light of the lack of compliance by the IRC and
the legislature with the procedures set forth in the Constitution, the
legislature’s enactment of the 2022 redistricting maps contravened the
Constitution.</p></li>
<li><p>Along with being procedurally flawed, the 2022 congressional map
enacted by the legislature violates the constitutional provision
prohibiting partisan gerrymandering.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>State Respondents</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Asserted that petitioners lack standing to challenge many of the
districts that they claim reflect unconstitutional partisan
gerrymandering because none of the individual petitioners reside in
those districts.</p></li>
<li><p>Argued it is wrong to interpret the 2014 constitutional
amendments as requiring two separate IRC plans as a precondition to the
legislature’s exercise of its longstanding and historically unbridled
authority to enact redistricting legislation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rely on the 2021 legislation authorizing the legislature to move
forward on redistricting even if the IRC fails to submit maps as
permissibly filling a purported gap in the constitutional
design.</p></li>

<li><p>Argued that the 2022 election cycle is already underway.</p></li>

<td><strong>Dissenting in Part: Troutman, J.</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>“I dissent as to the majority’s advisory opinion on the
substantive issue of whether the plans constitute political
gerrymandering and as to the remedy.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Once this Court holds that the 2022 plans were
unconstitutionally enacted [procedurally] and must be stricken on that
threshold basis, it should not then step out of its judicial role to
further opine on the purely academic issue of whether the 2022
congressional map failed to comply with the substantive requirements of
section 4(c)(5).”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Given the procedural violation flowing from the breakdown in the
constitutional process, the court must fashion a remedy that matches the
error.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Court should order the legislature to adopt either of the two
plans that the IRC has already approved pursuant to section 5-b(g).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Given the existence of these IRC-approved plans, there is no need
for a redistricting plan to be crafted out of whole cloth and adopted by
a court.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The remedy ordered by the majority takes the ultimate
decision-making authority out of the hands of the legislature and
entrusts it to a single trial court judge.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It may ultimately subject the citizens of this State, for the
next 10 years, to an electoral map created by an unelected individual,
with no apparent ties to this State, whom our citizens never envisioned
having such a profound effect on their democracy.</p></li>
<li><p>That is simply not what the people voted for when they enacted
the constitutional provision at issue; although the IRC process is not
perfect, it is preferable to a process that removes the people’s
representatives entirely from the process.</p></li>

<td><strong>Dissenting: Wilson, J.</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>“I agree with Judge Troutman that Article III, Section 5 of the
Constitution means that the majority’s referral of this matter to a
special referee is not allowable, and I further agree that her proposed
solution of requiring the Legislature to act on the Independent
Redistricting Commission (“IRC”) maps that have been submitted, though
novel, would be acceptable in the unusual circumstances presented
here.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>She also fully concurs in Judge Rivera’s dissenting opinion,
though does not view it as inconsistent with Judge Troutman’s.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The 2022 redistricting plan itself did not violate the
Constitution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The burden a plaintiff must meet to overturn legislative action
as violative of the New York Constitution is extraordinarily high
(beyond a reasonable doubt standard).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The majority incorrectly treats the lower courts’ review of the
evidence as an unreviewable question of fact, as opposed to a reviewable
question of law—it is inaccurate to suggest that the Court is without
power to review the Appellate Division’s ruling on the partisan
gerrymander claim, because the case is before the court as an appeal as
of right based on CPLR 5601(b) (<em>see Cayuga Indian Nation of New York
v. Gould</em>, 14 N.Y.3d 614, 635 (2010) (“[A] query concerning the
scope and interpretation of a statute or a challenge to its
constitutional validity” is a “pure question of law”)).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Rejects the petitioners’ evidence which fell into three
categories.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) At best, Mr. Trende’s (petitioners’ expert elections analyst
and doctoral candidate) results are incomplete and inconclusive, and are
thus legally insufficient to meet the above standard.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If a given map ends up discouraging competition or favoring a
political party, that map does not necessarily run afoul of the
Constitution’s prohibition. Instead, an <u>intent to discourage</u>
competition or to favor that political party must be shown for the map
to violate the Constitution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mr. Trende’s analysis may show the <em>what</em>, but it cannot
show the <em>why</em> (i.e., the intent).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The novelty of Dr. Imai’s (non-peer reviewed) (based on thousands
of non-existent simulated maps) algorithm and the opacity of Mr.
Trende’s implementation of it create very substantial doubt as to his
conclusions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mr. Trende did not use the accepted Markov Chain Monte Carlo
simulation to compare his results, nor did he provide the models,
inputs, data sets, or output maps that formed the basis for his
analysis.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mr. Trende admittedly did not attempt to have his simulations
account for several of the constitutionally required factors, such as
the protection of racial and language minority voting rights and
communities of interest, which could largely explain what he found as
gerrymandering.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The models also overweighted compactness and county integrity,
and Mr. Trende failed to give sufficient reasoning to explain his
methodology.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mr. Trende, in suggesting that the State respondents should find
and fix the problems with his model, also improperly attempted to shift
the burden of proof from the petitioners to the State respondents, which
itself is legal error requiring reversal.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(2) The projected loss of 4 Republican Congressional seats (out
of 8 that currently exist) assumes that factors unrelated to how the
districts were drawn have not caused the result.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The 2012 districts are obsolete and not a relevant source of
comparison; population and registration shifts demonstrate that New
York’s voting populace has changed in the Democrats’ favor.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(3) The contention that Republicans were excluded from the
process, without more, does not meet the high bar to invalidate the 2022
plan.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>That the process was dominated by one party is a result of the
current political reality of the Legislature.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While that may be “partisan” in one sense, it is not in the sense
that would be necessary to show an <em>intent</em> to violate the
Constitution.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Also, the adoption of the 2021 Legislation and the failed
constitutional amendment are not particularly probative as to
intent.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is equally possible that the Legislature, seeing the
possibility of electoral chaos in the event that the IRC failed to act
as required, clarified that the outcome would be the same as if the IRC
produced plans that the Legislature rejected.</p></li>

<td><strong>Dissenting: Rivera, J.</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>“I would reverse the Appellate Division judgment because
petitioners failed to establish that the legislature violated the
state’s redistricting procedures or constitutional mandates.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, the legislature acted within its authority by adopting the
redistricting legislation challenged here after the Independent
Redistricting Commission (IRC) chose not to submit a redistricting plan
by the second constitutional deadline. Thus, there is no procedural
error rendering the redistricting legislation void ab initio. There are
two supportable analytic paths:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) the process followed by the legislature here does not violate
the text or purpose of article III because the IRC in fact submitted two
plans, albeit all at once, in furtherance of the purpose of section 4,
and, in any case, the legislature is not bound to approve an IRC plan as
drafted.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Constitution is simply silent on how to address the IRC’s
choice to forego submission of a redistricting plan and implementing
legislation before the second deadline.</p></li>
<li><p>The constitutional framework does not command that the
legislature remain idle in the face of an IRC decision not to submit a
plan despite section 4(b)’s mandatory language setting forth deadlines
for submission.</p></li>
<li><p>The majority’s decision leaves the legislature hostage to the
IRC, and thus incentivizes political gamesmanship by the IRC
members.</p></li>
<li><p>The majority’s interpretation ignores that legislative plans may
include “any amendments” that are “deem[ed] necessary” (NY Const, art
III, § 4 [b]), giving the legislature significant discretion to reject
the IRC’s proposals.</p></li>
<li><p>Likewise, the two percent rule—which the majority seems to
interpret as a constitutional requirement—is also not properly before
us, and in any case, that statutory rule applies only when the IRC
submits a plan by the second deadline, which concededly it did not
do.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(2) The constitution is silent as to how to respond when the IRC
does not submit a plan in accordance with Article III, as in this case
where the IRC chooses not to make a second deadline submission.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thus, the 2021 legislation that anticipated the
stalemate—properly enacted—controls.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Second, Petitioners’ claim of a substantive violation based on
gerrymandering is also without merit as their evidence fell far short of
proving that the legislature’s congressional map was unconstitutional
beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“For reasons discussed at length in Judge Wilson’s thorough and
compelling analysis of petitioner’s evidence and gerrymandering claim,
which I fully join, petitioners failed to carry their burden.”</p></li>
