-   *Adams v. DeWine*, No. 2021–1428 (Ohio Dec. 2, 2021).

    -   Plaintiffs Adams et al. filed a complaint alleging that the
        “General Assembly and the Governor blatantly disregarded that,
        in 2018, Ohioans voted three to one to amend the Ohio
        Constitution to eliminate the pernicious gerrymandering of
        Ohio’s congressional districts” by once again enacting “a rank
        partisan gerrymander—one that violates both the letter and the
        spirit of the 2018 reforms.”

    -   Plaintiffs requested that the court “declare that the
        apportionment plan adopted by Respondents . . . invalid for
        failure to comply with Article XIX of the Ohio Constitution”;
        issue a permanent injunction and judgment; hold hearings,
        consider briefing and evidence; and to retain jurisdiction of
        the action.

    -   Plaintiffs argued that 2021 Congressional Plan violated of
        Article XIX, Section 1(C)(3)(a) of the Ohio Constitution, which
        prohibits any plan “that unduly favors or disfavors a political
        party or its incumbents” and that the 2021 Congressional Plan
        violated Article XIX, Section 1(C)(3)(b) of the Ohio
        Constitution, which states that the “general assembly shall not
        unduly split governmental units, giving preference to keeping
        whole, in the order named, counties, then townships and
        municipal corporations.”
