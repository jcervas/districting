<td><strong>Procedural History</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>On 10/11/2021, Petitioners filed a petition challenging the
validity of the 2021 Oregon congressional redistricting plan (SB
881).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Petitioners asked that their alternative plan be adopted, and
alleged:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) that SB 881 violates ORS 188.010(2) (“[n]o district shall be
drawn for the purpose of favoring any political party, incumbent
legislator or other person”), because SB 881 was enacted for the purpose
of favoring the Democratic Party, Democratic incumbent legislators, and
“other person[s]” affiliated with the Democratic Party.</p></li>
<li><p>(2) that SB 881 violates Article 1, sections 8 and 26 of the
Oregon Constitution, which guarantee freedom of expression and assembly,
respectively, which together prohibit partisan gerrymandering.</p></li>
<li><p>(3) that SB 881 violates Article I, section 20, and Article II,
section 1—the Privileges and Immunities Clause and the Free and Equal
Elections Clause—of the Oregon Constitution, which “prohibit[s] the
Oregon State Legislature from drawing and adopting a partisan
gerrymandered redistricting map.”</p></li>
<li><p>(4) that SB 881 violates ORS 188.010(1) (requiring consideration
of five criteria: contiguity, equal population, existing geographic or
political boundaries, communities of common interest, and transportation
links).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Pursuant to 2021 Oregon Laws, Chapter 419 (SB 259), § 1(6), the
Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court appointed a SJP to hear the
petition.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The SJP, in turn and pursuant to SB 259 § 1(7)(c), requested
appointment of a Special Master, Senior Judge Henry C. Breithaupt, to
receive evidence and to prepare recommended findings of fact in
21CV40180.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Presiding Judge adopted the Special Master’s Recommended
Findings of Fact as more fully set out in her Order on Evidentiary and
Procedural Matters dated November 15, 2021.</p></li>
<li><p>The SJP adopted the Special Master’s Recommended Findings of Fact
and incorporated them by reference into this Opinion.</p></li>

“if the plan complies with all applicable statutes and the United States
and Oregon Constitutions.”</p></li>

legislatively adopted reapportionment plan fails in one of those
respects.</p></li>

<td><strong>Holding(s)</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>The Circuit Court held that the Petitioners failed to demonstrate
that the legislatively adopted congressional reapportionment plan, SB
881, does not comply with all applicable statutes and the United States
and Oregon Constitutions in any of the ways they have asserted.</p></li>

<td><strong>Rationale</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p><strong>The plan satisfies the first prong of the
<em>Hartung</em> test</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The fact that some Service Employees International Union Local
503 (SEIU) members were aware that publicly available modeling tools
rating various proposed maps were discussed with some members of the
Legislative Assembly, was insufficient to show the Legislative Assembly
failed to consider any statutory criteria.</p></li>
<li><p>When considered in the light of the facts related to ORS
188.010(1), it is clear that there were logical reasons for drawing
district lines in the manner that SB 881 did.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Evidence that the Legislative Assembly drew district lines to
keep specific communities of interest together rebuts claims that the
Legislative Assembly had a partisan purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Legislative Assembly heard and received a remarkable volume
of evidence from Oregon citizens, considered it, and made adjustments to
the draft maps in response to public testimony.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The metrics for the enacted map demonstrate that the map is well
within the range of historic maps that have been adopted by prior
legislative assemblies or courts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>That evidence demonstrated that the enacted map was well within
the range of plans that legislatures and courts have adopted in Oregon
for the past 50 years and that the enacted map is more favorable to
Republicans than any map since 1990.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The plan satisfies the second prong of the
<em>Hartung</em> test</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Petitioners hinge much of their case on what they view as
compelling evidence of the Legislative Assembly’s unlawful partisan
purpose, but their arguments suffer from numerous legal and factual
deficiencies.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The legal standard they propose ignores Oregon precedent and
misapplies the caselaw on which they do rely and the evidence they point
to is exaggerated, mischaracterized, or both.</p></li>
<li><p>Ultimately, the extensive record in this case establishes that,
far from being motivated by partisan purpose, the Legislative Assembly
drew the enacted map based on public input and neutral
criteria—resulting in a fair map that was not drawn for a partisan
purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>The Legislative Assembly had sound reasons for the various
line-drawing choices they made, including and especially the decisions
to divide the Portland area among four districts and place Bend in the
Fifth Congressional District.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Court rejected Petitioners’ request that it adopt a per se
rule that a party-line vote is enough to establish a violation of Oregon
law</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We respect the legislative process in Oregon and decline to adopt
the cynical view that all politics are dirty politics.</p></li>
<li><p>Such a standard would vest in the minority party absolute control
of whether a plan will be presumed to unlawfully favor a political
party.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A minority party could simply vote against any plan along party
lines, regardless of the merits of the plan, and thereby create a
presumption of improper purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus, we conclude that the details of the vote do not tell us
anything about the quality of the plan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The contours of the new congressional districts reflect, to the
extent possible, the historic boundaries of past districts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The division of the Portland area among four congressional
districts is a key theme of Petitioners’ case. . . . [b]ut even setting
aside the neutral justifications for dividing the Portland area among
multiple districts, Petitioners ignore that this mapmaking decision has
long been a feature of Oregon’s congressional maps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Far from reflecting a partisan purpose, the enacted map’s
treatment of the Portland area—and the state as a whole—is consistent
with prior maps adopted with both judicial imprimatur and bipartisan
support.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Petitioners have not proven that the enacted plan will have an
impermissible partisan effect.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The enacted map’s consistency with previous maps demonstrates the
plan’s lack of impermissible partisan effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Testimony of Dr. Paul Gronke demonstrates, the enacted map’s
efficiency gap—Petitioners’ preferred metric for measuring partisan
bias—“falls well within the range of plans that have been used in the
state for the past fifty years.”</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Gronke’s conclusions strongly suggest that any measurable
bias is not the result of partisan machinations, since this same bias
can be measured in maps enacted by the judiciary and bipartisan
majorities of the Legislative Assembly—which are unlikely to enact
congressional plans for political advantage.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no evidence that rural interests were disrespected.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To the contrary, SB 881 amplifies rural voices by including
substantial rural and agricultural communities in all six of Oregon’s
congressional districts, thus ensuring that each of Oregon’s members of
Congress represents rural interests and concerns.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Although Petitioners urge the SJP to adopt a per se test that any
plan with at least a 7% efficiency gap score has an impermissible level
of partisan effect, this per se test has several shortcomings.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Although Petitioners claim that the test is easy to calculate and
administer, the record in this case belies that claim.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Experts in the case assessed the efficiency gap score of the map
and came to varying conclusions.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if we were tempted to adopt the efficiency gap analysis as
the basis for determining whether a map has an impermissible partisan
effect, we cannot conclude from the record what the appropriate inputs
ought to be.</p></li>
<li><p>The metric is easily manipulated, dependent on the types of past
election results that measure vote distribution which go into the
calculation of votes that do not contribute to an election win between
the two parties.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Having reached the conclusion that Petitioners have
failed to meet their burden of proof as to partisan purpose or effect,
the SJP dismisses both of Petitioners’ constitutional claims without
further discussion.</strong></p></li>
