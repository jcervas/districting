<td><strong>Procedural History</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>On 6/15/2017, Petitioners, the League of Women Voters and 18
voters—all registered Democrats—filed suit against the Commonwealth.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Count 1: Petitioners alleged that the 2011 Plan violates their
rights to free expression and association under Article I, §§ 731 and
2032 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The General Assembly created the 2011 Plan by "expressly and
deliberately consider[ing] the political views, voting histories, and
party affiliations of Petitioners and other Democratic voters" with the
intent to burden and disfavor Petitioners' and other Democratic voters'
rights to free expression and association.</p></li>
<li><p>The Plan "also violates the Pennsylvania Constitution's
prohibition against retaliation against individuals who exercise their
rights under" these articles.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Count 2: Petitioners alleged the Plan violates the equal
protection provisions of Article 1, §§ 1 and 2633 of the Pennsylvania
Constitution, and the Free and Equal Elections Clause of Article I,
Section 534 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Plan intentionally discriminates against Petitioners and
other Democratic voters by using "redistricting to maximize Republican
seats in Congress and entrench [those] Republican members in
power."</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 10/16/2017, Judge Dan Pellegrini granted a stay of the
Commonwealth Court [trial court] proceedings pending the United States
Supreme Court's decision in <em>Gill v. Whitford</em>, No. 16-1161 (U.S.
argued Oct. 3, 2017).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>However, Petitioners filed with this Court an application for
extraordinary relief, asking that we exercise extraordinary jurisdiction
over the matter, and the Court granted that application on
11/9/2017.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Court thereafter remanded the matter to the Commonwealth
Court to "conduct all necessary and appropriate discovery, pre-trial and
trial proceedings so as to create an evidentiary record on which
Petitioners' claims may be decided."</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Commonwealth Court, by the Honorable P. Kevin Brobson,
conducted a nonjury trial from 12/11 through 12/15, and submitted to the
Court its recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law on
12/29/2017.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Commonwealth Court first rejected Petitioners' argument that
the 2011 Plan violated their rights to free speech and free
assembly.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Commonwealth Court characterized Petitioners' claims as
actually seeking a declaration that they are entitled to a redistricting
plan "free of any and all partisan considerations," noting that such a
right was "not apparent in the Pennsylvania Constitution or in the
history of gerrymandering decisions in Pennsylvania or throughout the
country," and that both the United States Supreme Court and this Court
have previously acknowledged that partisan considerations may play some
role in redistricting.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Next, the Commonwealth Court noted that courts must have some
judicially administrable standard by which to appraise partisan
gerrymanders, and found that Petitioners presented no such
standard.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, even assuming arguendo that Petitioners' putative
retaliation claim was cognizable under Pennsylvania law, the
Commonwealth Court found that Petitioners failed to establish the
same.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Petitioners failed to establish that the General Assembly caused
them to suffer any injury that would chill a person of ordinary firmness
from continuing to engage in such activity, essentially because they
remained politically active.</p></li>
<li><p>Petitioners failed to establish that the General Assembly's
adoption of the 2011 Plan was motivated in part as a response to
Petitioners' participation in the political process, essentially
reasoning that intent to gain a partisan advantage over a rival faction
is not equivalent to an intent to punish the faction's voters, that
gleaning the intent of the General Assembly as a body was largely
impossible, and that the fact that some Democratic state representatives
voted in favor of the 2011 Plan undermined the notion that its intent
was to punish Democratic voters.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Next, the Commonwealth Court rejected Petitioners' argument that
the 2011 Plan violated their rights to equal protection and their right
to free and equal elections.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Commonwealth Court opined that, "[i]n the context of partisan
gerrymandering, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has stated that the Equal
Protection Guarantee is coterminous with the Equal Protection Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution[.]"</p></li>
<li><p>Although acknowledging that Petitioners had established
intentional discrimination—in that the General Assembly was likely aware
of, and intended, the 2011 Plan's political consequences—the
Commonwealth Court determined that Petitioners could not establish that
they constituted an identifiable political group.</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, the Commonwealth Court found that Petitioners had
failed to establish that they would be disadvantaged at the polls or
would lack political power or fair representation, noting that they
remain free to participate in democratic processes.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Thereafter, the Court ordered expedited briefing, and held oral
argument on 1/17/2018.</p></li>

<li><p>Following the 2010 federal census, PA’s share in the House was
reduced from 19 to 18 members.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As a result, the Commonwealth was required to redraw its
congressional district map.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In 2011, the Republican-led General Assembly was tasked with
reconstituting Pennsylvania's congressional districts.</p></li>
<li><p>On 9/14/2011, Senate Bill 1249 (SB 1249), principally sponsored
by the Republican leadership, was introduced; on 12/14/2011, the bill
was referred to the Senate State Government Committee, amended to
include the proposed congressional boundaries, and was referred to the
Senate Appropriations Committee.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Senate declined to adopt an amendment proposed by Democratic
Senator Jay Costa, and passed SB 1249, in a 26-24 vote, with all
Democrats voting against passage; the bill was passed to the House of
Representatives [House State Government Committee], on the same
day.</p></li>
<li><p>On 12/15/2011, SB 1249 was brought up for first consideration,
and, for second consideration on 12/19/2011.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On 12/20/2011, the bill was referred to the House Appropriations
Committee and passed in a 136-61 vote, with 36 Democrats voting in favor
of passage.</p></li>
<li><p>On 12/22/2011, SB 1249 proceeded to the governor's desk where
then-Governor Corbett signed it into law as Act 131 of 2011 (the 2011
Plan).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Notably, of the 67 counties in Pennsylvania, the 2011 Plan
divided a total of 28 counties between at least two different
congressional districts.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, whereas, prior to 1992, no municipalities in PA
were divided among multiple congressional districts, the 2011 Plan
divided 68, or 2.66%, of PA’s municipalities between at least two
Congressional districts.</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, in reducing the numbers of seats from 19 to 18 in
accordance with the census reapportionment, the 2011 Plan placed
then-Democratic Congressman for the 12th Congressional District Mark
Critz and then-Democratic Congressman for the 4th Congressional District
Jason Altmire into the same district.</p></li>

Commonwealth to select representatives to govern their affairs based on
considerations of the region of the state in which they lived, and the

<td><strong>Rationale</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p><strong>PA case law supports an expansive interpretation of the
Free and Equal Elections Clause, <span class="smallcaps">Pa.
Const.</span> art. I, § 5.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In <em>Patterson v. Barlow</em>, 60 Pa. 54 (Pa. 1869), the court
held that while the Constitution gives to the General Assembly the power
to promulgate laws governing elections, those enactments are nonetheless
subject to the requirements of the Free and Equal Elections Clause of
our Constitution, and, hence, may be invalidated by the Court "in a case
of plain, palpable and clear abuse of the power which actually infringes
the rights of the electors."</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>See also Winston v. Moore</em>, 91 A. 520 (Pa. 1914)
(reaffirming that the clause protected a voter's individual right to an
equal, nondiscriminatory electoral process); <em>In re New Britain
Borough School District</em>, 145 A. 597 (Pa.1929) (emphasizing that the
rights protected by this provision may not be taken away by an act of
the legislature, and that that body is prohibited by this clause from
interfering with the exercise of those rights, even if the interference
occurs by inadvertence).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>While it is true that the court had not heretofore held that a
redistricting plan violates the Free and Equal Elections Clause based on
partisan gerrymandering, the court has never precluded such a claim in
its jurisprudence.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In <em>Erfer</em>, the court rebuffed the argument that Article
I, Section 5 was limited in its scope of application to only elections
of Commonwealth officials, inasmuch as there was nothing in the plain
text of this provision which would so limit it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Erfer</em> did not foreclose future challenges under Article
I, Section 5 resting solely on independent state grounds.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We reject Justice Mundy's assertion that <em>Erfer</em> requires
us, under the principles of stare decisis, to utilize the same standard
to adjudicate a claim of violation of the Free and Equal Elections
Clause and the federal Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To the extent that <em>Erfer</em> can be read for that
proposition, we expressly disavow it, and presently reaffirm that, in
accord with <em>Shankey</em> and the particular history of the Free and
Equal Elections Clause, recounted above, the two distinct claims remain
subject to entirely separate jurisprudential considerations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Court formally adopts historical neutral traditional
redistricting criteria</strong><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <strong>to measure
compliance with the Free and Fair Elections Clause.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Neither Article I, Section 5, nor any other provision of our
Constitution, articulates explicit standards which are to be used in the
creation of congressional districts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>However, since the inclusion of the Free and Equal Elections
Clause in our Constitution in 1790, certain neutral criteria have, as a
general matter, been traditionally utilized to guide the formation of
our Commonwealth's legislative districts in order to prevent the
dilution of an individual's vote for a representative in the General
Assembly.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Because these factors [<em>see</em> footnote 3] are deeply rooted
in the organic law of our Commonwealth, and continue to be the
foundational requirements which state legislative districts must meet
under the Pennsylvania Constitution, we find these neutral benchmarks to
be particularly suitable as a measure in assessing whether a
congressional districting plan dilutes the potency of an individual's
ability to select the congressional representative of his or her choice.
. . .</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They are wholly consistent with the overarching intent of the
framers of the 1790 Constitution.</p></li>
<li><p>Because the character of these factors is fundamentally impartial
in nature, their utilization reduces the likelihood of the creation of
congressional districts which confer on any voter an unequal
advantage.</p></li>
<li><p>Use of these objective factors substantially reduces the risk
that a voter in a particular congressional district will unfairly suffer
the dilution of the power of his or her vote.</p></li>
<li><p>These standards also comport with the minimum requirements for
congressional districts guaranteed by the United States Constitution, as
interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Wesberry v.
Sanders</em>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We recognize that other factors have historically played a role
in the drawing of legislative districts, such as the preservation of
prior district lines, protection of incumbents, or the maintenance of
the political balance which existed after the prior reapportionment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>However, we view these factors to be <u>wholly subordinate</u> to
the neutral criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is [now] sufficient to establish a violation of this section
to show that these traditional criteria were subordinated to other
factors.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>It was clear, plain, and palpable that the 2011 Plan
subordinates the traditional redistricting criteria in the service of
partisan advantage.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Compelling expert statistical evidence presented before the
Commonwealth Court, in combination with and illustrated by an
examination of the Plan itself and the remainder of the evidence . . .,
demonstrates that the Plan cannot plausibly be directed at drawing
equally populous, compact, and contiguous districts which divide
political subdivisions only as necessary to ensure equal population.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All of Dr. Chen's Simulated Set 1 plans . . . were more compact
and split fewer political subdivisions than the 2011 Plan, establishing
that a process satisfying these traditional criteria would not lead to
the 2011 Plan's adoption.</p></li>
<li><p>Lay examination of the Plan reveals tortuously drawn districts
that cause plainly unnecessary political-subdivision splits.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>These districts often rend municipalities from their surrounding
metropolitan areas and quizzically divide small municipalities which
could easily be incorporated into single districts without detriment to
the traditional redistricting criteria.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Dr. Chen also credibly rejected the notion that the 2011 Plan's
outlier status in this regard was attributable to an attempt to account
for Pennsylvania's political geography, to protect incumbent
congresspersons, or to establish the 2011 Plan's majority-African
American district.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>[H]e explicitly concluded that the traditional redistricting
criteria were jettisoned in favor of unfair partisan gain.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>At the district-by-district level, the 2011 Plan's geospatial
oddities and divisions of political subdivisions and their wards
effectively serve to establish a few overwhelmingly Democratic districts
and a large majority of less strong, but nevertheless likely Republican
districts.</p></li>

<td><strong>Concurring and Dissenting: Baer, J.</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>I continue to join the Majority's conclusion that the 2011 Plan
violates the Pennsylvania Constitution . . . [and] I concur with the
Majority's explication of the Free and Equal Election Clause and the
Court's ultimate conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p>However, I diverge from the Majority, which I read to impose
court-designated districting criteria on the Legislature.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="smallcaps">U.S. Const.</span> art. I, § 4 does not
encompass the judicial branch, and thus, courts lack the authority to
prescribe the "times, places, and manner of holding" congressional
elections.</p></li>
<li><p>In contrast to the state legislative and municipal districts, the
Constitution is silent in regard to the criteria to be applied by the
Legislature in establishing congressional districts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This language obviously does not address the size or shape of
districts.</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, there is nothing inherent in a compact or contiguous
district that insures a free and equal election, as is evidenced by
claims of unconstitutional gerrymandering raised in challenges to
redistricting plans of other states which employ maps created in
compliance with the traditional districting criteria of compact and
contiguous territory, equality of population, and minimization of
municipal line division.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I do not view . . . the utilization of traditional districting
criteria as dispositive in every redistricting case.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Rather, I would hold that extreme partisan gerrymandering occurs
when, in the creation of a districting plan, partisan considerations
<u>predominate</u> over all other valid districting criteria relevant to
the voting community and result in the dilution of a particular group's
vote.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On this basis, Petitioners in the case at bar clearly, plainly
and palpably demonstrated that partisan considerations predominated over
other relevant districting criteria in the drawing of the 2011 Plan and
resulted in extreme partisan gerrymandering in violation of
Pennsylvania's Free and Equal Election Clause.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I additionally dissent from the portions of the Majority Opinion
which enjoin the use of the 2011 Plan for the 2018 election cycle and
set forth a procedure for implementing a new map for the May 2018
primary.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In my view . . . the Court's remedy threatens the separation of
powers . . . by failing to allow our sister branches sufficient time to
legislate a new congressional districting map, potentially impinges upon
the due process rights of the parties at bar as well as other interested
parties, and foments unnecessary confusion in the current election
cycle.</p></li>
<li><p>I continue to suggest respectfully that the Court reconsider its
decision given the substantial uncertainty, if not outright chaos,
currently unfolding in this Commonwealth regarding the impending
elections, in addition to the likely further delays that will result
from the continuing litigation before this Court and, potentially, the
United States Supreme Court, as well as from the map-drawing process and
the litigation that process will inevitably engender.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Legislature does not have a fair opportunity to act "in the
first instance" where it has less than three weeks to develop a
plan.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While it is true that the Legislature technically enacted the
2011 Plan in two weeks, it is naïve to think that the legislators
created the map in that short period of time—the Legislature began
hearings on the districting map as early as 5/2011, suggesting that the
development of the map spanned at least eight months.</p></li>
<li><p>In <em>Butcher</em>, of which the Majority relies, the Court in
1964 had provided the Legislature nearly one year to enact a valid
map.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In contrast, this Court has provided the Legislature three weeks
from the initial order to produce a new map.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This case does not present a situation where the election cannot
go forward under the current map, such as presumably would occur if the
plan provided for more representatives than could be seated in
Congress.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Indeed, the current map has been utilized for three election
cycles, and the Majority is allowing it to be employed again in the
upcoming special election for the 18th District.</p></li>
<li><p>It is, therefore, unnecessary to act prior to the 2018
elections.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I do not agree that allowing parties to submit a map comports
with due process absent their ability to respond to alternative plans,
potentially by submitting additional evidence or cross-examining
witnesses.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Moreover, the Majority's remedy lacks any provision for the
parties to object following the release of the Court's map, which may
indeed be necessary to advise the Court of any potential oversights or
infirmities in the map itself.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I object to the lack of transparency of [the potential judicial
map creation] process and urge the Court to provide the parties and the
public constitutionally-mandated due process by allowing an opportunity
to object to any plan that the Court may adopt.</p></li>

<li><p>In summary, I believe that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The present exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction was
improvident;</p></li>
<li><p>This Court's review would benefit from anticipated guidance from
the Supreme Court of the United States;</p></li>
<li><p>Awaiting such guidance is particularly appropriate given the
delay, until 2017, of Petitioners' challenge to a 2011 redistricting
plan; and</p></li>
<li><p>The appropriate litmus for judicial review of redistricting
should take into account the inherently political character of the work
of the General Assembly, to which the task of redistricting has been
assigned by the United States Constitution.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Supreme Court of the United States has . . . emphasized . . .
that redistricting is committed to the political branch and is
inherently political.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Since these considerations [of how much gerrymandering is too
much] are not constitutional commands applicable to congressional
redistricting, the majority's approach amounts to a non-textual,
judicial imposition of a prophylactic rule.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In this regard, it is significant that the majority's new rule is
overprotective.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Moreover, in terms of the individual-rights component—and
contrary to the majority's perspective—there is no right to an "equally
effective power" of voters in elections. . . .</p>

of the law to persons, not equal representation in government to
equivalently sized groups.</p></li>
<li><p>It nowhere says that farmers or urban dwellers, Christian
fundamentalists or Jews, Republicans or Democrats, must be accorded
political strength proportionate to their numbers."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I would abide by the Court's previous determination [in
<em>Erfer</em>], in the redistricting setting, that the Free and Equal
Elections Clause provides no greater protection than the state charter's
Equal Protection Clauses, which have been deemed coterminous with the
protection provided by the United States Constitution.</p></li>
<li><p>The majority's focus on a limited range of traditional
districting factors allocates too much discretion to the judiciary to
discern violations in the absence of proof of intentional
discrimination.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The discretion belongs to the Legislature, which should be
accorded appropriate deference and comity, as reflected in the
majority's initial articulation of the presumption of constitutionality
and the heavy burden borne by challengers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In my judgment . . . Petitioners' entreaty to proceed with
extreme exigency presents too great of an impingement on the
deliberative process to allow for a considered judgment on my part in
this complex and politically-charged area of the law.</p></li>

<li><p>This is a political process [and] the General Assembly should be
afforded the full opportunity and adequate time to address.</p></li>
<li><p>The Majority cites <em>Butcher</em> as support for its remedy,
but omits that the Court in <em>Butcher</em> granted the General
Assembly 11 months to draft a new map before intervening, yet it
nevertheless concludes its remedy is "entirely consistent with . . .
<em>Butcher</em>."</p></li>
<li><p>This Court has always had the pragmatic option to utilize the
current congressional maps for the 2018 election, while allowing the
General Assembly the appropriate amount of time to redraw our
legislative districts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Further, . . . the magnitude and breadth of the Majority's remedy
is inconsistent with the restraints imposed by federal law.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Elections Clause [<span class="smallcaps">U.S. Const.</span>
art. I, § 4] at its core, grants the authority to draw a state's
congressional districts to the state legislatures, Congress, or an
independent redistricting commission.</p></li>
<li><p>While this Court is certainly the final arbiter of the meaning of
the Pennsylvania Constitution, it may not remedy any violations of our
state charter, in a manner, that the Federal Constitution
prohibits.</p></li>
<li><p>Further, [t]urning to the cases of the Supreme Court of the
United States cited by the Majority, none of them support the remedy
contemplated here.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Distinguishing <em>Scott</em>, <em>Growe</em>, and <em>Wise</em>
from the instant case.</p></li>

<li id="fn1"><p>The expert testimony from Dr. Jowei Chen, Dr. John
Kennedy, Dr. Wesley Pegden, and Dr. Christopher Warshaw (petitioners),
and Dr. Wendy K. Tam Cho and Dr. Nolan McCarty (respondents), was

<li id="fn2"><p>Should the PA General Assembly choose to submit a
congressional districting plan that satisfies the requirements of the PA
Constitution, it shall submit such plan for consideration by the
Governor on or before 2/9/2018. If the Governor accepts the General
Assembly's congressional districting plan, it shall be submitted to this
Court on or before 2/15/2018. Should the General Assembly not submit a
congressional districting plan, or should the Governor not approve the
General Assembly's plan, this Court shall proceed expeditiously to adopt
a plan based on the evidentiary record developed in the Commonwealth
Court. In anticipation of that eventuality, the parties shall have the
opportunity to be heard; to wit, all parties and intervenors may submit
to the Court proposed remedial districting plans on or before
2/15/2018.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn3"><p>The neutral traditional redistricting criteria that the
Court adopted to measure compliance with Article I, Section 5 were as
follows: whether the congressional districts created under a
redistricting plan are (1) composed of compact and contiguous territory;
(2) as nearly equal in population as practicable; and (3) which do not
divide any county, city, incorporated town, borough, township, or ward,
except where necessary to ensure equality of population. <em>Id.</em> at
816–17. Importantly, however, the Court noted that the neutral
traditional redistricting criteria are “not the exclusive means by which
a violation of Article I, Section 5 may be established.”<a
