**UTAH**

-   *League of Women Voters of Utah v. Utah State Legislature*, No.
    220901712 (Utah D. Ct. Mar. 17, 2022).

    -   LWVU Plaintiffs et al. filed a complaint alleging that (1) the
        Utah Legislature’s 2021 Congressional Plan “violates multiple
        provisions of the Utah Constitution, including the Free
        Elections Clause, the Uniform Operation of Laws Clause,
        protections of free speech and association, and the right to
        vote; and (2) that “the Legislature’s repeal of Proposition 4
        \[a bipartisan citizen initiative that prohibited partisan
        gerrymandering\] violated the people’s constitutionally
        guaranteed lawmaking power and right to alter and reform their
        government.”

    -   Plaintiffs requested that the 2021 Congressional Plan be
        declared unconstitutional in violation of the Utah Constitution,
        to enjoin the Defendants from using the Plan, to compel
        Defendants to perform their redistricting duties in a manner
        that comports with the UT Constitution, to set a new deadline by
        which new maps would be due, to declare the 2020 repeal of
        Proposition 4 of the Utah Independent Redistricting Commission
        and Standards Act unconstitutional, and to retain jurisdiction.

    -   Plaintiffs argued that the Plan was a Partisan Gerrymander in
        Violation of the Utah Constitution’s:

        -   Free Elections Clause, Article I, Section 17;

        -   Equal Protection Rights, Article I, Sections 2 and 24;

        -   Free Speech & Association Rights — Article I, Sections 1 and
            15;

        -   Affirmative Right to Vote Protections — Article IV, Section
            2;

    -   Plaintiffs also argued that the unauthorized repeal of
        Proposition 4 was in violation of the Utah Constitution’s
        Citizen Lawmaking Authority to Alter or Reform Government,
        Article I, Section 2; Article VI, Section 1.
