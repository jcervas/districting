# ABSTRACT {#abstract .list-paragraph}

# 

After the U.S. Supreme Court opted out of any federal court role in
policing partisan gerrymandering in its 2019 decision, *Rucho v. Common
Cause*, if a redistricting plan was alleged to be a partisan gerrymander
only state courts could act to review the map and possibly find it
unconstitutional under state (rather than federal) law. Here we focus on
state court decisions in litigation alleging partisan gerrymandering in
maps drawn for elections to the US. House of Representatives in the
2020s redistricting round in cases decided before the November 2022
elections Our emphasis is on doctrinal changes in state law and the use
of social science evidence. We are primarily interested in two issues.
(1) How did state courts faced with a redistricting challenge based on a
claim of "excessive" partisanship decide whether or not state law
allowed them to address the factual aspects of the claim rather than
treating the claim as non-justiciable? While some states have direct
language in their state constitution that, in effect, barred partisan
gerrymandering \-- often language recently added via the initiative
process, the bulk of states do not. Thus, if a state were to choose to
review claims that a map was a partisan gerrymander, it would have had
to be creative in interpreting long standing language in their state
constitution (e.g., about "free and open elections") as providing a
legal justification for court intervention. (**2) Which types of indicia
of a partisan gerrymander did state courts who chose to confront claims
on the merits make use of?** ~~(3) Is there evidence that the partisan
affiliations of justices affected whether or not they voted to overturn
as a partisan gerrymander a map drawn by their co-partisans as opposed
to a map drawn by a legislature controlled by the other party.~~

# I. INTRODUCTION

State courts can become involved in the redistricting process (a) when
those with primary redistricting authority fail to enact a plan in a
timely fashion~~,~~ or (b) when they are the site of litigation
challenging a plan as violating requirements of the state's own
constitution or other elements of state law. If they cannot motivate the
primary redistricting authority to draw a constitutional map under
specified time constraints, state courts can decide to draw their own
map. [^4] In this essay we limit ourselves to redistricting cases that
came before state courts, and we limit ourselves to cases challenging
plans for the U.S. Congress[^5] and, except for some background
information from the 2010 redistricting round, we limit ourselves to
cases brought in the 2020 redistricting round that were decided before
the November 2022 elections.[^6] Most importantly, we focus on questions
relating to partisan gerrymandering. Because of the Supreme Court's 2019
abdication in *Rucho v. Common Cause* of any federal court
responsibility to police partisan gerrymandering,[^7] claims of partisan
gerrymandering have become the exclusive domain of state courts.[^8]
But, going into the 2020 round, state courts had largely been uninvolved
with issue of partisan gerrymandering.[^9]

While there has been other work on the role of state courts as a check
on partisan gerrymandering in the 2020 redistricting round, both in
terms of an overview[^10] and in examining what happened in individual
states (**CITES**), our approach in this essay is distinctive in being
more explicitly jurisprudentially focused on the changes in the
perceived role of state courts post-*Rucho* and in looking at the use by
state courts of social science evidence. We look at the actual reasoning
used by state courts in cases where claims of partisan gerrymandering
were raised, looking both at state courts who struck down a plan as
violating the state constitution and at state courts who upheld a
legislative (or commission) map against such a challenge. While we have
most to say about direct challenges to maps as partisan gerrymanders, we
also take notice of activities of a state court triggered by the failure
of the principal redistricting authority to enact a new map in time for
elections, since any court drawn map will also have partisan
consequences.

For the 2020s round of congressional redistricting we go beyond merely
identifying the highest level state court resolution of the challenge
and look at the decision breakdown on that court and the differences in
judicial reasoning and evaluation of empirical evidence found across
justices both within and across states. We are primarily interested in
two issues. (1) How did state courts faced with a redistricting
challenge based on a claim of a denial of equal treatment and
"excessive" partisanship decide whether or not state law allowed them to
address the actual aspects of the claim, rather than rather than
following the U.S. Supreme Court and treating the claim as
non-justiciable? In seeking to answer this question we distinguish
between those states that had some direct prohibition on partisan
gerrymandering from those where a prohibition must be inferred from long
existing provisions of the state constitution. (2) How did state courts
who chose to confront claims on the merits decide on the indicia of a
partisan gerrymander. In particular, how did they make use of empirical
evidence -- e.g., measuring the extent of gerrymandering via metrics
based on election data, evaluating maps in terms of the degree to which
traditional good government criteria were satisfied, and/or considering
the process of map drawing and what it implied about partisan intent? We
leave to s subsequent essay ~~t partisan gerrymandering claim was
accepted as justiciable under state law, how did state constitutional
provisions affect the likelihood that, *ceteris paribus,* a partisan
gerrymandering challenge would prove successful l~~ the question of
whether there is evidence that the partisan affiliations of justices
affected whether or not they voted to overturn as a partisan gerrymander
a map drawn by their co-partisans as opposed to a map drawn by a
legislature controlled by the other party? [^11]

Before we address these two issues we introduce some useful background
information about the 2020 redistricting round.

Table 1, incorporating data compiled in Cervas, Grofman, and Matsuda
(2023, forthcoming: Table 1, Table 4, and text) reports on a state by
state basis some basic data about the 2020 redistricting process ca.
2022, such as what type of entity was in charge of districting in the
state and, for states where plans were under legislative control,
whether or not there were unified party control and if so, in favor of
which party. [^12] Table 1 shows states where partisan gerrymandering
claims vis-Ã -vis congressional districting were made [^13] and it shows
whether or not those states actually had a partisan gerrymandering
challenge in state court. For the cases where a partisan gerrymandering
challenge was brought, or a race-related challenge with partisan
implications was brought, we distinguish cases where the highest state
court issued a ruling prior to the November 2022 election and those
which can be seen as still pending ca 2023. For the partisan
gerrymandering cases where we have a definitive court opinion, we
indicate whether there was a ruling on the merits versus a finding by
the state court that partisan gerrymandering was not a justiciable
offense under that state's constitution. Where there was a definitive
ruling we identify whether that ruling found in favor of
plaintiffs.[^14] So as to locate within a single table information for
easy access on multiple factors that affected whether or not a partisan
challenge was successful, we also include within this table some
important information about the nature of the state constitutional
provisions relevant to partisan gerrymandering. We show whether or not
the state constitution provides either a direct check on partisan
gerrymandering (e.g., a requirement that a plan neither favor or
disfavor any political party) or an indirect check in terms of language
similar to that relied upon by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court when it
overturned a congressional map as a partisan gerrymander, *see League of
Women Voters of Pa. v. Commonwealth*, 178 A.3d 737 (Pa. 2018) (i.e.,
language such as that stating a requirement for "free and equal
elections.")

NOTE: States we identify as meeting the conditions for the potential
enactment of a legislative gerrymander are highlighted and shown in
bold.

Most of the state court cases we consider from the 2020s redistricting
round involved ones where the legislature is the primary redistricting
authority.[^26] In 33 of the 44 states where there was more than a
single congressional district, line drawing remained in the hands of
state legislatures in 2021. But this reflected a reduction in the
proportion of districts that were drawn by legislatures. In 2011,
commissions drew congressional maps in **FILL IN NUMBER OF** states; In
2021, commissions drew congressional maps in **FILL IN NUMBER OF**
states. Initiative procedures created the possibility that, in states
where redistricting had been in legislative hands, that control could be
removed from the legislature and put it into the hands of a bipartisan
or ostensible non-partisan commission. [^27] Although it is possible to
have partisan gerrymandering even when it is not legislative decisions
that determine the shape of the map,[^28] reformers viewed replacing
legislative control over the map-making process with a reapportionment
commission of a bi-partisan or non-partisan nature as a major goal.
[^29] The belief in the need for institutional reform of the
redistricting process only increased after the Supreme Court's decision
in *Rucho* **FILL IN WHICH STATES SHIFTED TO**

**COMMISSIONS BETWEEN 2011 AND 2021** **AND INDICATE WHICH SHIFTS ARE
*POST-RUCHO***

The likelihood of partisan gerrymandering is highest in situations where
one political party fully controls the redistricting process.[^30] The
most common way in which this full control occurs is with what is called
*trifecta control,* where the map is legislatively drawn and both
branches of the Table 2 provides more details at the state level about
partisan gerrymandering c legislature and the governor are under the
control of the same party, but it can also occur even without trifecta
control if the governor has no veto power over a redistricting map,[^31]
or if one party controls both branches of the legislature and the
governor of the opposite party but the majorities in each branch of the
legislature are sufficiently large to override a gubernatorial veto.
[^32] The number of states with trifecta control has increased since the
1980s especially as states have realigned after the "Solid South"
transitioned from Democratic control to Republican control.[^33]
**JONATHAN THINK ABOUT WORDING** However, although the total number of
[states]{.underline} where the redistricting process was wholly
controlled by a single party increased from 2010 to 2020, the number of
[districts]{.underline} in states under one party control decreased from
2010 to 2020.

Table 2 shows the litigation in states where there partisan
gerrymandering challenges raised in state court and identifies the
plaintiffs. **JONATHAN AND SCOTT I THINK THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE
DEFENDANTS IS OVERKILL, BUT IT IS STILL INTERESTING TO SEE HOW MANY
PERSONALLY NAMED PLAINTIFFS THERE ARE I WOULD MAKE THAT INFO A SEPARATE
TABLE TO GO INTO AN APPENDIX.**

Drawing on the information in Table 1 and Table 2 **and** other data
sources we can summarize some important facts about 2020s redistricting
as of November 2022.[^34]

1\. While full partisan control is not a sufficient condition for a
legislature to choose to impose a partisan gerrymander (or to maintain
one already in place), in the 2020 round, when we look at the states
where redistricting remained under legislative control -- still the vast
bulk of the states -- and consider that most of those were states where
one party controlled the redistricting process, the removal of any
possibility of a federal lawsuit to restrain gerrymandering led many
legislatures under one party control to offer congressional plans that
were labeled as partisan gerrymanders (or as racial gerrymanders with
important partisan implications) by journalists in the state (and/or by
academics). [^35]

2\. State courts were far more involved in redistricting in the 2020
round than in any previous redistricting round, with the most important
congressional cases involving challenges to congressional maps as
partisan gerrymanders. XX of the 28 states where we have identified a
public allegation that partisan gerrymandering was found in the
congressional map had an actual partisan gerrymandering challenge in
state court to that map entered prior to November 2022, although not all
were resolved prior to the 2022 election.[^36]

3 An usually high proportion of partisan gerrymandering challenges were
left unresolved in the 2020 redistricting round (**q** of **qq**), with
plans permitted for use in the 2022 election only. **PLEASE PROVIDE
DETAILS IN A FOOTNOTE**

4\. The proportion of partisan gerrymander challenges to legislatively
drawn maps in states under one party control (**Y** of **YY**) resolved
by November 2022 is much higher than the proportion of partisan
gerrymander challenges to legislatively drawn maps in states under
divided control (X of XX).

5\. In most of the cases where there was a partisan gerrymandering
challenge resolved by November 2022, the state court found in favor of
plaintiffs: **X** of **XX** instances. [^37]

6\. The proportion of successful partisan gerrymander challenges to
legislatively drawn maps in states under one party control (**Y** of
**YY**) resolved by November 2022 is much higher than the proportion of
successful partisan gerrymander challenges to legislatively drawn maps
in states under divided control (Y of YY).[^38]

7\. While these comparisons must be interpreted with care since the
nature of the case facts obviously affects the outcome, and commissions
differ in their institutional rules, we see that the likelihood of a
partisan challenge being brought to a congressional plan was higher in
challenges brought to a legislative map (q of QQ challenges vs. R of RR
challenges) and the success rate of plaintiffs in challenges to a
legislatively drawn map was higher than the success rate of challenges
to a map drawn by a commission (**Y** of **YY vs. Z** of ZZ) .

8\. In the 2020 redistricting round, not only did Republicans have many
more [states]{.underline} under one party control than did the
Democrats, there were also many more congressional districts in states
under full Republican control than there were congressional districts in
states under full Democratic control. Though the difference was smaller
than in the 2010 round, partisan control in 2020 redistricting round
still very disproportionately favored one party, the Republicans, and
the partisan disproportionality from the partisan gerrymandering in the
2010 round reinforced the Republican advantage in the 2020 round because
of the advantages of incumbency that persisted even as district
configurations changed. [^39]

9\. The proportion of challenges to congressional maps in states under
Democratic control was lower than that in states under Republican
control (**X** of **XX** vs. **Y** of **YY**) and the proportion of
successful challenges to congressional maps in states under Democratic
control was lower than that in states under Republican control (**X** of
**XX** vs. **Y** of **YY**) .

10\. We expect that partisan gerrymandering litigation will come
**from** non-partisan groups such as League of Women Voters or Common
Cause, or local groups that identify themselves in non-partisan terms,
[^40] or groups of voters who are whose strong partisan identifications
make them willing to sign on to partisan gerrymandering litigation when
recruited by party officials What we see from Table 2 is interesting. In
the 2010 round**,** since there were only a handful of cases brought in
state court it is easy to determine **that it was** good government
groups such as the League of Woman Voters and Common Cause **which
were** the plaintiffs in the majority of these early partisan
gerrymandering cases in state court. **SCOTT PROVIDED DETAILS IN A
FOOTNOTE** During the 2020 redistricting cycle, although non-partisan
groups continued to be active, many of the plaintiffs were explicitly
(or implicitly) affiliated with the political party that served to gain
from state courts overturning the enacted plan. **Jonathan and scott IS
THIS CORRECT? I KNOW WE MAY NEED TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER**

Now we turn to **the two** key questions about state court jurisprudence
in the 2020 redistricting round identified above.

# II. **TWO** KEY QUESTIONS

## 1. How did state courts faced with a redistricting challenge based on a claim of a denial of equal treatment and "excessive" partisanship decide whether or not state law allowed them to address the actual aspects of the claim, rather than following the U.S. Supreme Court and treating the claim as non-justiciable? 

To answer this question we must first turn to the specific language of
state constitutional provisions. We anticipate that states that have an
explicit prohibition on partisan gerrymandering in the form of a
prohibition on favoring or disfavoring particular parties or candidates
will be more likely, *ceteris paribus*, to have a gerrymandering
challenge brought.[^41] But, as shown in the Pennsylvania and North
Carolina cases from the 2010 round, we recognize that other (older)
language in the state constitution that is less direct **ADD FOOTNOTE
WITH** **THE VARIETIES OF STATE CONSTITUTIONAL LANGUAGE ABOUT EQUALITY
IN THE ELECTION CONTEXT** can also be used to justify bringing a
partisan gerrymandering challenge. For justices who found that their
constitution had language in the state constitution they felt could be
used to make a judgment that a plan was unconstitutional we look to see
what language they cited to. How were particular state constitutional
requirement interpreted vis-a-vis providing a justification for
rejecting plans as unconstitutional gerrymanders?

How, *ceteris paribus*, does the nature of state constitutional
provisions concerning gerrymandering affect the likelihood that a
partisan gerrymandering challenge will be successful? We expected (and
found) a high probability that, *ceteris paribus*, trifectas states will
have their plans challenged, but we also recognize that the likelihood
of challenge and especially the likelihood of successful challenge
depends on the state-specific legal environment as well as on
state-specific case fact. We showed above that states that have an
explicit prohibition on partisan gerrymandering in the form of a
prohibition on favoring or disfavoring particular candidates or on the
use of partisan data, or which have a provision prohibiting seeking
favoring or disfavoring particular candidates will be more likely,
*ceteris paribus*, to have a gerrymandering challenge brought. But we
also expect that, if brought, *ceteris paribus*, such a challenge is
more likely to be successful where there are direct provisions seeking
to make egregious gerrymandering unconstitutional.

TO REWRITE

*Hypothesis 6c. We expect a higher rate of success of partisan
gerrymandering challenges to congressional maps in states where there is
only an indirect constitutional constraint on partisan gerrymandering
than in states where there is a direct bar on partisan gerrymandering.*

*Hypothesis 6c'. We expect a lower rate of success of partisan
gerrymandering challenges to congressional maps in states where there is
only an indirect constitutional constraint on partisan gerrymandering
than in states where there is a direct bar on partisan gerrymandering*

The reason we have listed two contradictory hypotheses above is that
there are arguments pointing in both directions. On the one hand, absent
a direct bar on gerrymandering we might expect it to be difficult for
plaintiffs to prevail in gerrymandering claims. On the other hand, in
states where there is a direct bar on partisan gerrymandering we might
expect mapmakers to be more cautious about drawing partisan gerrymanders
and thus better able to resist having plans overturned. [^42]

The evidence for neither of these two hypotheses is strong. **IS THIS
CORRECT?** In states where legislatures draw maps and there is a direct
state constitutional bar on partisan gerrymandering **PP** of **XX**
challenges were successful(**qq%**). In contrast in states where
redistricting was under legislative control but there was only an
indirect potential constraint on redistricting. **PP** of **zz**
challenges were successful(**qq%**).

We can classify failed claims of partisan gerrymandering in terms of (a)
rejections of claims based on purely legal grounds, i.e., states where
justices asserted that their constitution simply did not provide a cure
for partisan gerrymandering, (b) rejection of claims based partly almost
entirely on empirical grounds , i.e., assertions that the evidence
presented did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation, (c)
rejection of claims based partly on legal and partly on empirical
grounds, *e.g.,* states where a justice, echoing the views of the
Supreme Court majority in *Rucho*, simply rejected the idea that it was
possible to accurately measure (in advance of an election) the extent of
partisan gerrymandering and thus no legally manageable standard was
possible. Table 3 presents this tabulation of the three categories,
state by state, based on our reading of each of the individual opinions
in the **XX** states where a partisan gerrymandering claim was brought
in state court.[^43] Table 4, in the next section goes into more detail
about exactly which tests were applied.

.

\<\<Table 3 about here \>\> **TO PROVIDE**

TO INTEGRATE WITH ABOVE We can classify state court justice's rejection
of a partisan gerrymandering claim as (a) rejections of claims based on
purely legal grounds, i.e., states where a justice asserted that its
constitution simply did not provide a cure for partisan gerrymandering,
(b) rejection of claims based partly almost entirely on empirical
grounds , i.e., assertions that the evidence presented did not rise to
the level of a constitutional violation, (c) rejection of claims based
partly on legal and partly on empirical grounds, *e.g.,* states where a
justice, echoing the views of the Supreme Court majority in *Rucho*,
simply rejected the idea that it was possible to accurately measure (in
advance of an election) the extent of partisan gerrymandering and thus
no legally manageable standard was possible. Table 3 presents this
tabulation of the three categories, state by state, based on our reading
of each of the individual opinions in the **XX** states where a partisan
gerrymandering claim was brought in state court.[^44] We provide more
detailed information about the opinions of individual justices and the
criteria they used later in the text.

HYPOTHESIS 8a: In each state, most justices who accepted a claim that a
map was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander provided multiple types
of arguments to justify this decision; however, low scores on various
statistical metrics of partisan gerrymandering was the most frequently
given reason for a finding of partisan gerrymandering.,

HYPOTHESIS 8b: In each state, most justices who rejected a claim that a
map was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander did do on the basis of
a legal finding that the state constitution did not provide a remedy for
partisan gerrymandering, rather than because they rejected the empirical
evidence as inadequate.

Hypothesis 8b we see **FILL IN**

**THIS MATERIAL ON THE NEXT SIX PAGES NEEDS TO BE COMPLETELY REWRITTEN
OR MOST LIKELY DELETED SINCE MUCH OF IT IS ALREADY FOUND IN THE
DISCUSSION OF TABLE 1 ABOVE HYPOTHESES ABOUT STATE COURTS WITH AGGREGATE
DATA IN TABULAR FORM**

### A. Where were challenges brought? {#a.-where-were-challenges-brought .list-paragraph}

The 2010 round is widely regarded as the one involving the most
egregious partisan gerrymandering of the post-*Baker v. Carr* era[^45]
\<\<Table 1 about here from New Hampshire paper)

Table 1, taken from Cervas, Grofman and Matsuda (2023 forthcoming),
identifies in bold the states where a claim was made that the adopted
congressional map in that state should be considered a political
gerrymander. [^46] Table 1 also provides information about whether a
claim was heard in state court, and whether that challenge was either
successful (at least in part) or unsuccessful. In addition, Table 1
describes the nature of the state constitutional provision(s) that might
be used to regulate partisan gerrymandering. From these cases and from
those instances where no claim was made in state court we can draw
several hypotheses that speak to the ability of state courts to cure
partisan gerrymandering.[^47]

HYPOTHESIS 1: Where there was state constitutional language explicitly
forbidding partisan gerrymandering [and]{.underline} where there were
assertions that a potential challenge to the congressional map might be
justified, there would be such a challenge in virtually all states in
this category.

HYPOTHESIS 2: Where there was old constitutional language that might be
adapted to allow for a gerrymandering challenge but no direct language
explicitly forbidding partisan gerrymandering [and]{.underline} where
there were assertions that a potential challenge to the congressional
map might be justified, there would be such a challenge in most states
in this category.

HYPOTHESIS 3: Where there was [neither]{.underline} old constitutional
language that might seen to be adaptable to allow for a gerrymandering
challenge nor direct language explicitly forbidding partisan
gerrymandering or incumbency protection, even when there were assertions
that a potential challenge to the congressional map might be justified
almost never would a partisan gerrymandering challenge be brought.

In looking at the evidence for these hypotheses we confine ourselves to
the XX states where some claims had been made that a congressional plan
was a partisan gerrymander, and we omit states with a single
congressional district.

The evidence for Hypothesis 1 is strong. Of the **XX** states with
direct language that could be viewed as anti-gerrymandering, a challenge
to the map was brought in **YY** states (**LIST NEEDED**). Thus it would
not appear that direct language was successful in causing maps to be
implemented that did not receive challenge.

The evidence for Hypothesis 2 is also strong, though, as expected, the
proportion of challenges in lower in this category with indirect
anti-gerrymandering language that in the category of states with direct
anti-gerrymandering provisions. Of the **XX** states with indirect
language (but NOT direct language) that could be viewed as
anti-gerrymandering, a challenge to the map was brought in **YY** states
(**LIST NEEDED**).

The evidence for Hypothesis 3 is very strong, the proportion of cases
brought in this category is lower than that in the category of states
with indirect anti-gerrymandering provisions. Of the **XX** states with
neither direct nor indirect language that could be viewed as
anti-gerrymandering, a challenge to the map was brought in only **Y**
states (**LIST NEEDED**).

Some of the exceptions to our expectation that partisan gerrymandering
challenges to congressional maps would be brought in states with some
form of actual or potential anti-gerrymandering constitutional provision
came in states where the map was drawn by a commission rather than the
legislature though, even in such cases, challenges did occur. For the
next two hypotheses we look at all states, not merely those where there
were gerrymandering claims made.

Hypothesis 4a. Ceteris paribus, we expect legislatively-drawn
congressional maps (for states with more than a single congressional
district) to have a higher proportion being characterized as partisan
gerrymanders than is the case for commission-drawn maps.

*Hypothesis 4b. Ceteris paribus, we expect legislatively-drawn
congressional maps to have a higher rate of challenge as partisan
gerrymanders than commission maps.*

The evidence for Hypothesis 4a is strong. In commission states **XX** of
**YY** states were labeled by at least some sources as partisan
gerrymanders (**qq%**). In contrast in states where redistricting was
under legislative control **XX** of **YY** states were labeled by at
least some sources as partisan gerrymanders (**qq%**). The evidence for
Hypothesis 4B is also strong. In commission states **XX** of **YY**
states were challenged as partisan gerrymanders (**qq%**). In contrast
in states where redistricting was under legislative control **SS** of
**TT** states were challenged as partisan gerrymanders (**zz%**).
However, when we control for the fact that the commission states and the
legislatively-mapped states differ in the nature of their
anti-gerrymandering provision, some of the strength of these differences
is dissipated. **HERE WE NEED A BREAKDOWN BY 1) WHO CONTROLS
REDISTRICTING, 2) WHETHER THERE IS A PARTISAN GERRY CHALLENGE, AND 3)
CONTROLS FOR WHAT CONSTIT ANTI-GERRY PROVISIONS ARE IN PLACE. BUT THE
SMALL CELL SIZES MAY VITIATE AGAINST MAKING SENSE OF ANY SUCH
COMPARISONS! STILL WE SHOULD TRY**. Nonetheless it does appear that
commission states were better than states where maps were drawn by
legislators at avoiding both the appearance of being partisan
gerrymanders and legal challenge as a partisan gerrymander**.
DOUBLECHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS CLAIM IS TRUE.**

Another obvious comparison is between those states that are under
legislative control and under one party control and those state states
that are under legislative control but have divided government. For the
next hypothesis we again look at all states, not merely those where
there were gerrymandering claims made.

*Hypothesis 5 Ceteris paribus, we expect a higher proportion of
challenges to congressional maps in states where congressional mapping
is are under legislative control [and under one party
control]{.underline} than to those state states that are under
legislative control [but have divided government.]{.underline}*

The evidence for Hypothesis 5 is **strong**. In states where mapping is
under legislative control [and under one party control]{.underline}
**XX** of **YY** states were challenged (**pp%**) In contrast in states
[under]{.underline} where redistricting was under legislative control
but party control was divided **XX** of **YY** states were challenged
and PP of those XX challenges were successful(**qq%**).

To complete our analysis we mention states where failure of
redistricting authorities to act led to state court intervention. In
this circumstance, in XX states the state court drew a map (**LIST
STATES**), or they decided that a remand to the legislature (or
commission) for construction of a new map was needed and ultimately
accepted the redrawn map (**LIST STATES**), or they decided that a given
map could only be used only for 2022 pending a post-2022 decision on the
merits of the gerrymandering claim (**LIST STATES**) -- usually because
the case came late in the redistricting cycle and the court concluded
that there was not enough time to order a new map without interfering
with the election schedule. [^48]

The evidence for Hypothesis 6b is **strong**. In states where
legislatures draw maps and the process is under one party control **PP**
of XX challenges were successful(**qq%**). In contrast in states where
redistricting was under legislative control but party control was
divided **XX** of **YY** **PP** of **zz** challenges were
successful(**qq%**).

The above hypotheses deal with whether a gerrymandering claim was raised
in state court and how the challenge was resolved. But in understanding
American electoral politics it is useful to consider who/which groups
are bringing these partisan gerrymandering claims.

In particular, what types of empirical evidence were made use of-- e.g.,
measuring the extent of gerrymandering via metrics based on election
data, evaluating maps in terms of the degree to which traditional good
government criteria were satisfied, and/or considering the process of
map drawing and what it implied about partisan intent ? But also, what
threshold did courts use to decide when gerrymandering rose beyond
"politics as usual" to become a constitutional violation?

**END SECTION OF MATERIAL THAT NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN OR DELETED**

## 2. Which indicia of a partisan gerrymander were referenced. 

We can have claims of gerrymandering based (1) on the failure of maps to
satisfy traditional good government criteria (**CITES**) and/or (2) on
statistical tests of partisan bias/partisan vote dilution (**CITES**),
and/or (3) process grounds such as failure to comply with requirements
for public comment, or votes on passage that are entirely along partisan
lines (**CITES**), and/or (4) on examination of specific changes made in
the proposed map vis-a-vis the (constitutional??) map from the last
decade such that inferences could be drawn about a deliberate intent to
achieve partisan advantage. (**CITES**) In Table 4 we characterize each
of the majority (or sometimes plurality opinions if there is no single
majority opinion) in terms of checkoffs using these four categories.
When available, we also provide in that table the exact language used to
define a partisan gerrymander. **But we leave to a subsequent essay a
detailed discussion, on a metric by metric basis , of exactly how did
state court justices who opted to regulate gerrymandering set a
threshold to decide when that metric could be taken to provide evidence
that the level of partisan gerrymandering was beyond "politics as usual"
and rose to the level of a constitutional violation.** [^49]

[^5]: The issues in partisan gerrymandering challenges to legislative
    maps are very similar to those for congressional maps, which is why
    they are sometimes brought together. But there are differences in
    terms of specific provisions in state law about legislative
    redistricting. For example, in Minnesota, in addition to the
    traditional redistricting criteria required for both legislative and
    congressional redistricting, legislative maps are further prohibited
    from intentionally favoring or disfavoring an incumbent and both
    Kentucky and North Carolina must further consider the preservation
    of communities of interest. *See Redistricting Criteria*, [Nat'l
    Conf. of State Leg.]{.smallcaps} (July 16, 2021),
    https://www.ncsl.org/redistricting-and-census/redistricting-criteria.
    In addition, legislative and congressional maps within a state may
    be subject to different requirements simply because the state is
    apportioned just one congressional district. Related issues arise in
    local redistricting, but the majority of local elections are
    formally non-partisan in nature in that party labels are not on the
    ballot. Of course, even in non-partisan elections, the partisan
    orientations of many candidates may be known---at least to the more
    sophisticated voters. For example, in the City of Irvine, candidates
    for mayor in the 21^st^ century have included someone who sought the
    Democratic Party nomination for President, and another who was a
    Republican Party leader in the California Senate.

[^6]: Due to limitations in the time remaining to hold a trial and then
    to draw a new constitutional map, a court may end up accepting the
    use for one election only of a challenged map that might later prove
    to be unconstitutional.. Decisions on some congressional
    redistricting cases brought in 2021 or 2022 were postponed until
    after the November 2022 election. *See Merrill v. Milligan*, 595
    U.S. \_ (2022) (granting Alabama's motion to stay a lower court
    order to redraw a second majority-black congressional district and
    allowing the likely unconstitutional maps to be used for the 2022
    election under the *Purcell* principle); *see also* *Alpha Phi Alpha
    v. Raffensperger*, Nos. 1:21-CV-5337-SCJ, 1:21-CV-5339-SCJ, and
    1:22-CV-122-122-SCJ (N.D. Ga. Feb. 28, 2022) (finding that some
    parts of the redistricting plan were unconstitutional gerrymanders,
    yet similarly allowing the maps to be used for the 2022 election
    under *Purcell*). While we identify such cases we do not discuss
    them in any detail since our interest is in cases where there are
    court opinions/decisions to analyze.

[^7]: Despite several lower federal courts striking down congressional
    or legislative plans as violating the U.S. Constitution as egregious
    partisan gerrymanders in litigation involving 2010s redistricting,
    *see* *Whitford v. Gill*, 218 F. Supp. 3d 837 (W.D. Wis. 2016)
    (finding that the redistricting plan enacted by the Wisconsin
    Legislature, constituted an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander),
    *vacated* 138 S. Ct. 1916 (2018), *remanded* No. 15-cv-421-jdp, 2019
    U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111625 (W.D. Wis. July 2, 2019) (dismissing the
    lawsuit in light of *Rucho*); *see also* *Benisek v. Lamone*, 348 F.
    Supp. 3d 493 (D. Md. 2018) (concluding that the "plaintiffs have
    sufficiently demonstrated that Maryland\'s 2011 redistricting law
    violates the First Amendment by burdening both the plaintiffs'
    representational rights and associational rights based on their
    party affiliation and voting history"), *vacated Rucho*, 139 S. Ct.
    2484, **,** in reviewing the lower court decision in one of these
    cases, *Rucho v. Common Cause*, 139 S. Ct. 2484 (2019), a case from
    North Carolina, the Supreme Court's definitively abdicated any
    federal responsibility for policing partisan gerrymandering,
    claiming, *inter alia*, that no judicially manageable standard
    allowed for courts to distinguish gerrymandering rising to a level
    of unconstitutionality from politics as usual. *Rucho*, 139 S. Ct.
    at 2506--07 (concluding that "partisan gerrymandering claims present
    political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts. Federal
    judges have no license to reallocate political power between the two
    major political parties, with no plausible grant of authority in the
    Constitution, and no legal standards to limit and direct their
    decisions."). The Court's abdication of responsibility came 30+
    years after the Supreme Court had declared, in *Davis v. Bandemer*,
    478 U.S. 109 (1986), that partisan gerrymandering was, in principle,
    justiciable in federal courts. However, in those 30+ years, the
    Supreme Court failed to find any instances where it actually held a
    redistricting map to be unconstitutional. *See Vieth v. Jubelirer*,
    541 U.S. 267 (2004); *see also League of United Latin Am. Citizens
    (LULAC) v. Perry*, 548 U.S. 399 (2006).

[^8]: On the other side of the coin, although there are state
    constitutional or legislative provisions related to the role of race
    in redistricting, (*e.g.*, the California Voting Rights Act of 2001,
    Cal. Elec. Code Â§ 14025 et seq. (West 2011).), the primary locus for
    the resolution of race-related claims remains the federal courts.
    Federal courts deal with claims of violations of the U.S.
    Constitution in matters related to race in cases brought under
    Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as amended (*see e.g.*,
    *Thornburg v. Gingles*, 478 U.S. 30 (1986) or directly under the
    14^th^ or 15^th^ Amendments, including cases brought under the line
    of jurisprudence originating in *Shaw v. Reno*, 509 U.S. 630 (1993),
    where a map is challenged as unconstitutional because of having race
    as the preponderant criterion used by mapmakers.

    Identification of states where partisan gerrymandering claims were

    2022. We note that number of states have maps whose use courts have

[^18]: In some states (Connecticut, Indiana, and Ohio), commissions may
    also be used as backup if there is not political agreement on a
    congressional plan. *See* *infra* note 19.

[^19]: Maryland's plan was initially struck down by the state court, and
    under its supervision, the Legislature passed a replacement. On
    April 1, 2022, the Maryland Court of Appeals assumed jurisdiction
    over the appeal from the Court of Special Appeals, and on April 4,
    2022, both parties voluntarily dismissed the appeal after the
    Governor agreed to sign the new congressional redistricting plan
    into law.

[^20]: Map to be used in 2022 only.

[^21]: Under the [Ohio Const.]{.smallcaps} art. XIX, Â§ 1, the Ohio
    legislature first has the opportunity to draw congressional lines by
    a three-fifth's supermajority, including votes of half of each major
    party in each chamber. If that fails, the process goes to a
    seven-member backup commission, comprised of the Governor, State
    Auditor, Secretary of State, and one commissioner chosen by each of
    the legislative leadership. The plan must pass with votes from at
    least two members affiliated with each major party. If the
    commission fails to pass a plan, the state legislature may then pass
    a congressional plan via a simple majority subject to gubernatorial
    veto. Maps that are passed by a supermajority of the legislature or
    by bipartisan approval of the commission are valid for ten years,
    whereas maps passed by legislation are valid for only two general
    elections. In the 2020 redistricting cycle, the Ohio Redistricting
    Commission ran out the clock by continuing to move forward with
    gerrymandered maps.

[^22]: The Ohio map used was drawn by the legislature after earlier maps
    had been found by the state court to be partisan gerrymanders.
    Despite having itself also been found to be a gerrymander by the
    state court, that map was imposed by a federal court for use in 2022
    one because Ohio's constitution does not allow the state court to
    impose a map of its own if the legislature repeatedly fails to offer
    a constitutional map and the federal court concluded that there was
    insufficient time remaining before the November 2022 election for
    the legislature to create a new map and have it reviewed by the
    state court. **JONATHAN THINK ABOUT WORDING**

[^23]: In *League of Women Voters of Utah* *(LWVU)* *v. Utah State
    Legislature*, No. 220901712 (Utah D. Ct. Mar. 17, 2022), the
    plaintiffs a complaint alleging that the Utah Legislature's 2021
    Congressional Plan "violates multiple provisions of the Utah
    Constitution, including the Free Elections Clause, the Uniform
    Operation of Laws Clause, protections of free speech and
    association, and the right to vote; and that "the Legislature's
    repeal of Proposition 4 \[a bipartisan citizen initiative that
    prohibited partisan gerrymandering\] violated the people's
    constitutionally guaranteed lawmaking power and right to alter and
    reform their government." After the District Court denied the
    defendants' motion to stay and motion to dismiss, the defendants
    appealed the case to the Utah Supreme Court. In January 2023, the
    Utah Supreme Court agreed to hear the plaintiffs' partisan
    gerrymandering claims.

[^24]: The Commission missed the deadline for submission of its plan by
    only a few minutes and the state court held that it was in
    substnntial compliance. But the plan then had to referred to the
    legislature, which adopted it with only minor changes.

[^25]: In Wisconsin, the Court chose a plan, but it was based on the
    previous decade's plan, which was widely considered to be a
    gerrymander itself.

[^27]: **ADD A TYPOLOGY OF THE VARIETY OF COMMISSION TYPES**

[^28]: This can happen when a commission with evenly balanced partisan
    affiliations and a tie-breaker who is ostensibly neutral adopts a
    map proposed by one of the parties that results in a partisan
    gerrymander, or with commissions with serving state officials or
    state legislators as members whose selection rules leave open the
    possibility of one party having a majority of commission members. In
    2021 the latter situation was found in **PLEASE FILL IN**.

[^29]: Not all commissions are equal in terms of their likelihood of
    directly acting as a check on partisan gerrymandering For example,
    Hawaii, New Jersey and Virginia have commissions that may include
    current office-holders. **JONATHAN IS THAT CORRECT?** Moreover,
    several of the new commissions created prior to the 2020
    redistricting round were severely flawed, either in creating a high
    likelihood of deadlock (e.g., commissions with an equal number of
    members affiliated with each party and without any tie-breaker
    mechanism, such as the one in Virginia **CITE**), or with rules,
    such as those in Ohio **CITE**, that allowed the legislature to
    repeatedly override the court and that prevented the state court
    from imposing a plan of its own **CITE**.

[^34]: We leave, however, to the last section of this essay any
    discussion of the nature of state-court-ordered remedial maps that
    were created in states where courts were either required to draw a
    map of their own because they had rejected all congressional maps
    proposed by the initial redistricting authority or because that
    authority had failed to offer a congressional map in a sufficiently
    timely fashion. JONATHAN THINK ABOUT structure of THE PAPER

[^35]: Also, given the delay in the delivery of the census data needed
    for redistricting in 2021 (**CITE NEEDED**), even if state courts
    did accept a partisan gerrymandering challenge (or where there was
    litigation in a federal court involving a challenge to racial
    gerrymandering whose resolution almost certainly would have partisan
    consequences), legislators were aware that court action might come
    too late to prevent legislative plans from going into effect in the
    critical 2022 election -- thus allowing incumbency advantage for the
    gerrymandering party to carry over into the new redistricting
    decade. This happened in Florida CITE.

[^36]: There were also legal challenge to some congressional map brought
    on race-related grounds in a federal court.

[^37]: Among the maps not yet challenged, it is our view that some will
    eventually generate successful challenges. For example the Florida
    legislature (under instruction from the Florida governor (CITE))
    could be accused of having gone "hog wild" in the 2020 redistricting
    round in seeking to advantage Republicans **JONATHAN THINK ABOUT
    WORDING AND maybe discuss the Florida EXAMPLE in more detail. Also
    think about where this footnote belongs-here or in the concluding
    discussion.**

[^38]: There is a conditional probability effect in that we can expect
    challenges to be more likely to be brought and those challenges to
    be more likely to be successful in state where there actually is
    egregious partisan gerrymandering and expect that partisan
    gerrymandering is most likely to be found in states where the
    redistricting process is under single party control.

[^39]: In the 2010 redistricting round, Democrats had party control in
    six states (Arkansas, Illinois, West Virginia, Maryland,
    Massachusetts, Rhode Island; 44 total districts). Republicans had
    party control in eighteen states (Indiana, Oklahoma, Texas,
    Louisiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, Utah, South Carolina, North Carolina,
    Alabama, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Tennessee, Michigan, Virginia,
    Florida, Kansas, New Hampshire; 206 total districts). Although
    Democrats nominally controlled the process in Arkansas and West
    Virginia, these two states were at the end of a transition from
    single-party Democratic control to single-party Republican control.
    By the end of the decade, both states in both chambers had at least
    2-to-1 Republican-to-Democrat ratios. Nebraska's legislature is
    non-partisan. Going into 2020, Democrats controlled the
    redistricting process in eight states (Oregon, Massachusetts,
    Nevada, Illinois, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Maryland;
    seventy-five total districts). Republicans controlled the process in
    nineteen states (Indiana, West Virginia, Texas, Alabama, Iowa, North
    Carolina, Utah, Oklahoma, Georgia, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi,
    South Carolina, Tennessee, Kansas, Ohio, Florida, Missouri, New
    Hampshire; 183 total districts). In Kansas, the legislature was
    subject to the veto of the Democratic governor but overrode her veto
    with a supermajority vote. Nebraska's legislature is non-partisan.
    Thus, in 2020 Democrats controlled two more states than they had in
    2010, and Republicans controlled the process in one more state in
    2020 than they in 2010. But, more importantly for the U.S. House of
    Representatives, in terms of [districts]{.underline}, the advantage
    that Republicans had in 2010 (a 162 district advantage) was
    significantly reduced by 2020 (a 108 district advantage). The
    "district advantage" is calculated by finding the difference in the
    total number of districts for which each party had complete control
    over the process. Details are given in Tables 1 and 2 in Cervas,
    Grofman, Matsuda, 2023 forthcoming, *op cit*.

[^40]: Of course, such an identification might be merely a faÃ§ade for a
    group with a primarily partisan motivation.

[^41]: A state constitutional prohibition on the use of partisan data in
    the redistricting process -- found in the state constitutions of XX
    and YY, may also trigger a partisan gerrymandering claim if it is
    thought that the redistricting authorities have flouted that
    provision.

[^42]: We are not entirely surprised by this result, however, since both
    hypothesis have plausible foundations. But legislatures charged with
    drawing districts under explicit direction of the state law are
    likely to follow the law, knowing the consequence of not following
    the law is overturn and possibly forfeiture of control over the
    process in the remedial stage. This is the same reason we feel the
    Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act reduced the frequency of
    discriminatory maps in preclearance state. As the dissenters said in
    *Shelby Cnty. v. Holder*, 570 U.S. 529, 589 (2013)Â ("Throwing out
    preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop
    discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a
    rainstorm because you are not getting wet.")

[^43]: If more than one justice joins in an opinion we attribute the
    views in that opinion to each of its signators. If a justice also

[^46]: Among the boldings in Table 1 there are four states where
    challenges were made, but most academic or journalistic accounts
    would [not]{.underline} identify them as gerrymanders. New Jersey
    had a bipartisan commission draw its congressional plan. In
    Arkansas, New Mexico, and Kentucky, no court found there to be a
    partisan gerrymander Based on analytics, however, in all four of
    these cases there is some evidence that there might have been
    excessive partisan advantages, but all four of of these states are
    lopsidedly partisan and there are problems interpreting standard
    metrics to identify partisan gerrymandering when one party has a
    share of the vote far from an even division. This problem applies
    with particular force to the *efficiency gap* metric . For example,
    Planscore.org shows that Kentucky has an efficiency gap of 12.7%
    favoring the Republicans, and that the plan is in the tails of a
    distribution of all potential plans for Congress in Kentucky.
    Planscore.org,
    https://planscore.campaignlegal.org/plan.html?20220210T144538.556577174Z
    \[Accessed September 28, 2022\]. On the other side of the coin,
    Planscore.org shows that there is a pro-Democratic efficiency gap of
    8.8% in the New Jersey congressional map. Planscore.org,

[^47]: However, as noted earlier, there are several cases whose final
    disposition in federal court is not yet set as of the time of this
    writing (December 4, 2022)

[^48]: There are also XX states (**FILL IN STATES**) where claims were
    filed alleging of racial gerrymandering in violation of Section 2 of
    the Voting Rights Act or claimed violations of the language of *Shaw
    v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 642 (1993)*, barring as unconstitutional
    under federal law the use of race as a preponderant motive. *Shaw*
    claims: Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas. Section 2 claims:
    Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Ohio, Texas. Other race
    claims: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North
    Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas. Source, Brennan
    Center for Justice, "Litigation Over This Decade's New Maps",
    https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/redistricting-litigation-roundup-0
    \[Accessed September 17, 2022\].While these cases are not directly
    about partisan gerrymandering, because minority voters are
    disproportionately Democrat any plan that packs or cracks minority
    voters has partisan implications. Such race-linked challenges were,
    without exception, brought in federal courts. Challenges to plans as
    partisan gerrymanders were exclusively litigated in state court,
    given that no claimant would have standing in federal court
    post-*Rucho*. In XX states (**FILL IN STATES**) there are still
    pending claims of racial gerrymandering in violation of Section 2 of
    the VRA or claimed violations of the language of *Shaw v. Reno*;
    these will be litigated in 2023.

[^49]: This essay is the fourth essay by the present authors addressing
    issues in how state courts dealt with issues involved redistricting.
    The first of the two previous essays provides an overview of cases
    where state courts were involved with the redistricting process,
    including those where a state court was forced to draw a map because
    of the failure of the assigned authorities to draw a map in a time
    fashion. The second of the previous essays is more narrow and deals
    with two jurisprudential questions: (1) How did state courts faced
    with a redistricting challenge based on a claim of "excessive"
    partisanship decide whether or not state law allowed them to address
    the factual aspects of the claim rather than treating the claim as
    non-justiciable? While some states have direct language in their
    state constitution that, in effect, barred partisan gerrymandering
    \-- often language recently added via the initiative process, the
    bulk of states do not. Thus, if a state were to choose to review
    claims that a map was a partisan gerrymander, it would have had to
    be creative in interpreting long standing language in their state
    constitution (e.g., about "free and open elections") as providing a
    legal justification for court intervention. (2) How was
    gerrymandering conceptualized ? The third focuses on whether or not
    the partisanship of state court justices affected decisions.
